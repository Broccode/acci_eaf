## Operational Guidelines

### Error Handling Strategy

- **General Approach:** Utilize exceptions for error signaling in Kotlin/Spring backend services. A
  clear hierarchy of custom EAF exceptions (e.g., `EafValidationException`,
  `EafAuthorizationException`, `EafResourceNotFoundException`) extending base Spring/Java exceptions
  will be established. APIs will return standardized error responses (e.g., JSON problem details).
- **Logging (Mandatory):**
  - Library/Method: SLF4J with Logback, configured for structured JSON logging.
  - Format: JSON, including timestamp, severity, service name, thread ID, correlation ID (see
    below), logger name, message, stack trace (for errors), and custom contextual fields (e.g.,
    `tenant_id`, `user_id` where appropriate and safe).
  - Levels: Standard DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR. Consistent usage guidelines will be provided.
  - Context & Correlation IDs: All log messages related to a single request/operation across
    services must include a unique Correlation ID (e.g., propagated via HTTP headers or NATS message
    headers) for distributed tracing.
- **Specific Handling Patterns:**
  - **External API Calls (e.g., to `corenode` or federated IdPs):** Implement resilient client
    patterns:
    - Timeouts (connect and read).
    - Retries with exponential backoff and jitter for transient errors (using libraries like Spring
      Retry or Resilience4j).
    - Circuit Breaker pattern for services prone to unresponsiveness to prevent cascading failures.
    - Clear mapping of external API errors to internal EAF exceptions.
  - **Internal Errors / Business Logic Exceptions:** Custom exceptions will be caught by global
    exception handlers in API layers (e.g., Spring `@ControllerAdvice`) and translated into standard
    API error responses. Sensitive details will not be exposed to clients.
  - **NATS/JetStream Interactions (Event Publishing/Consumption):**
    - Publishing: At-least-once delivery with `PublishAck` handling. Retries for failed publishes.
      Consider Transactional Outbox for critical events if simple retries are insufficient.
    - Consumption: Idempotent consumers are mandatory. Explicit `ack()`, `nak()`, `term()` for
      messages. DLQ strategy for \"poison pill\" events. Robust error handling within listeners as
      per `NATS Multi-Tenancy JetStream Research` (section 2.4).
  - **Event Store Operations (Optimistic Concurrency):** The EAF Event Store SDK will handle
    optimistic concurrency exceptions during event appends and propagate them clearly for command
    handlers to manage (e.g., by retrying the command with re-read state or failing the operation).
  - **Transaction Management:**
    - Commands in CQRS should typically be processed within a single transaction that appends
      events.
    - Eventual consistency is accepted between the command side (event store) and read models.
    - Projectors updating read models should also manage their updates transactionally where
      appropriate and handle idempotency.

### Coding Standards

These standards are mandatory for all EAF core code and are strongly recommended for product
applications built on EAF. Linting and formatting tools will enforce many of these.

- **Primary Language:** Kotlin (for backend).
- **Style Guide & Linter/Formatter:**
  - Kotlin: Adhere to official Kotlin Coding Conventions.
  - Tooling: Spotless with Ktlint or Kfmt for automated formatting and linting, integrated into CI.
- **Naming Conventions (Kotlin):**
  - Packages: lowercase, dot-separated (e.g., `com.axians.eaf.iam.application.service`).
  - Classes/Interfaces/Objects/Enums/Annotations: PascalCase (e.g., `TenantProvisioningService`).
  - Functions/Methods/Properties (val/var): camelCase (e.g., `provisionNewTenant`).
  - Constants (compile-time `const val`, top-level or object `val` for true constants):
    SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS`).
  - Test Methods: backticks for descriptive names (e.g.,
    ``fun `should provision tenant when valid data is provided`() {}``).
- **File Structure:** Adhere to standard Gradle project layout (`src/main/kotlin`,
  `src/test/kotlin`). Within these, organize by feature or architectural layer (e.g.,
  `domain/model`, `application/port/in`, `infrastructure/adapter/out/persistence`) consistent with
  Hexagonal Architecture.
- **Unit Test File Organization:** Co-located with source files or in a parallel structure within
  `src/test/kotlin` (e.g., `MyService.kt` in `main` has `MyServiceTest.kt` in `test` in the same
  package). Test file names end with `Test`.
- **Asynchronous Operations (Kotlin):** Primarily use Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous
  programming. Adhere to structured concurrency principles. Avoid blocking threads unnecessarily.
- **Type Safety & Nullability (Kotlin):** Leverage Kotlin's null safety. Avoid platform types where
  possible. Use nullable types (`?`) explicitly. Minimize use of not-null assertion operator (`!!`).
- **Immutability:** Prefer immutable data structures (e.g., `val`, `List`, `Map`, Kotlin data
  classes with `val` properties) where practical, especially for DTOs, Value Objects, and Events.
- **Comments & Documentation:**
  - KDoc for all public APIs (classes, methods, properties).
  - Explain _why_, not _what_, for complex logic. Avoid redundant comments.
  - Module-level READMEs for significant libraries or services.
- **Dependency Management:** Use Gradle Version Catalogs (`libs.versions.toml`) for managing
  dependency versions. Avoid hardcoding versions in `build.gradle.kts` files.
- **Error Handling:** Use exceptions for error states. Define and use specific EAF exceptions. Avoid
  swallowing exceptions or catching generic `Exception` without specific handling or re-throwing.
- **Logging:** Use SLF4J for logging. Log meaningful messages with appropriate context (correlation
  IDs, tenant IDs where applicable and safe). Avoid logging sensitive information.
- **Spring Framework Usage:**
  - Prefer constructor injection for dependencies.
  - Use Spring Boot auto-configuration where possible.
  - Adhere to Spring best practices for defining beans, configurations, and profiles.

#### Detailed Kotlin Specifics

- **Functional Constructs:** Utilize Kotlin's functional programming features (lambdas, higher-order
  functions, collection operations like `map`, `filter`, `fold`) where they enhance readability and
  conciseness without sacrificing clarity.
- **Data Classes:** Use extensively for DTOs, Events, Commands, and simple Value Objects.
- **Sealed Classes/Interfaces:** Use for representing restricted hierarchies (e.g., different types
  of Commands for an Aggregate, or states in a state machine).
- **Extension Functions:** Use judiciously to enhance existing classes with utility functions,
  keeping them well-scoped and discoverable.
- **Coroutines:** Follow best practices for launching coroutines (e.g., within `CoroutineScope` tied
  to component lifecycle), error handling (e.g., `CoroutineExceptionHandler`), and context switching
  (`withContext`).

### Overall Testing Strategy

Testing is a cornerstone of ACCI EAF, with TDD being mandatory.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow

TDD is **mandatory** for all ACCI EAF development. The red-green-refactor cycle ensures
high-quality, well-tested code from the start.

#### The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

1. **ðŸ”´ RED:** Write a failing test first

   - Write the smallest possible test that fails
   - Ensure the test fails for the right reason (missing implementation, not syntax errors)
   - Run the test to confirm it fails

2. **ðŸŸ¢ GREEN:** Write minimal code to make the test pass

   - Implement just enough code to make the test pass
   - Don't worry about perfect design yet
   - Run the test to confirm it passes

3. **ðŸ”µ REFACTOR:** Improve the code while keeping tests green
   - Clean up the implementation
   - Improve design, remove duplication
   - Ensure all tests still pass after each change

#### Backend TDD (Kotlin/Spring)

**Example Reference:** See
`libs/eaf-sdk/eaf-core/src/test/kotlin/com/axians/eaf/core/example/calculator/CalculatorServiceTest.kt`

**Tools:**

- JUnit 5 for test framework
- MockK for mocking dependencies
- AssertJ for fluent assertions (optional)

**Test Structure:**

```kotlin
class ServiceTest {
    @Test
    fun `should do something when given valid input`() {
        // Given (Arrange)
        val input = "test"

        // When (Act)
        val result = service.doSomething(input)

        // Then (Assert)
        assertEquals(expected, result)
    }
}
```

**Running Backend Tests:**

```bash
# Run all tests
nx run-many -t test

# Run specific module tests
nx test eaf-core

# Run specific test class
nx test eaf-core --args="--tests \"CalculatorServiceTest\""
```

#### Frontend TDD (React/TypeScript)

**Example Reference:** See
`libs/ui-foundation-kit/src/components/SimpleCounter/SimpleCounter.test.tsx`

**Tools:**

- Vitest for test framework (fast, Vite-integrated)
- React Testing Library for component testing
- jsdom for browser environment simulation

**Test Structure:**

```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should render correctly when given props', () => {
    // Given (Arrange)
    render(<ComponentName prop="value" />)

    // When (Act)
    const element = screen.getByTestId('element-id')

    // Then (Assert)
    expect(element).toHaveTextContent('Expected Text')
  })
})
```

**Running Frontend Tests:**

```bash
# Navigate to ui-foundation-kit
cd libs/ui-foundation-kit

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui
```

#### TDD Best Practices for EAF

1. **Test Names:** Use descriptive names with backticks in Kotlin, clear descriptions in TypeScript
2. **Test Organization:** Follow Given-When-Then structure for clarity
3. **One Assertion Per Test:** Focus each test on a single behavior
4. **Mock External Dependencies:** Keep unit tests isolated and fast
5. **Test Edge Cases:** Include boundary conditions and error scenarios
6. **Refactor Regularly:** Don't skip the refactor step - it's crucial for maintainable code

#### Integration with CI/CD

All tests must pass before code can be merged:

- Backend tests run via `nx run-many -t test`
- Frontend tests run via `npm test` in each frontend module
- ArchUnit tests enforce architectural compliance
- Coverage reports help identify untested code paths

- **Tools (Backend):** JUnit 5, MockK (for Kotlin mocking), Spring Boot Test utilities, AssertJ (for
  fluent assertions), ArchUnit (for architecture rule validation), Testcontainers (for integration
  tests with PostgreSQL, NATS, etc.).
- **Unit Tests:**
  - **Scope:** Test individual Kotlin classes, functions, and small modules in isolation. Focus on
    business logic within Aggregates, Domain Services, Application Services, and utility classes.
  - **Location:** Typically co-located or in a parallel package structure in `src/test/kotlin`.
  - **Mocking/Stubbing:** Use MockK for creating test doubles. Mock all external dependencies (other
    services, database interactions via repository ports, NATS interactions via eventing ports).
  - **Target Coverage:** >80% line/branch coverage for core EAF logic.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - **Scope:** Test interactions between EAF components/services or between services and
    infrastructure (e.g., service layer to Event Store SDK to PostgreSQL; service layer to Eventing
    SDK to NATS). Test Hexagonal adapter integrations.
  - **Location:** Separate source set or directory (e.g., `src/integrationTest/kotlin`).
  - **Environment:** Use Testcontainers to spin up real instances of PostgreSQL and NATS/JetStream
    for reliable integration testing. Spring Boot test slices (e.g., `@DataJpaTest`,
    `@SpringBootTest` with specific components) will be used.
- **Architecture Tests (ArchUnit):**
  - **Scope:** Enforce architectural rules like layer dependencies (Hexagonal), DDD constraints,
    naming conventions, and domain purity (no infrastructure dependencies in domain code).
  - **Location:** Can be part of the main test suite or a dedicated test module.
  - **Implementation:** See detailed ArchUnit guidance below.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
  - **Scope:** Validate complete user flows or critical paths for applications like the ACCI EAF
    Control Plane MVP and the pilot application.
  - **Tools:** Playwright is mentioned for Hilla. This or similar for frontend E2E. For backend EAF
    service E2E tests, this might involve API-level tests orchestrating multiple service calls.
- **Performance Tests:**
  - **Scope:** Benchmark critical EAF operations and services against defined NFRs (response times,
    throughput).
  - **Tools:** JMeter, k6, or similar.
  - **Process:** Establish baseline benchmarks and run tests regularly (especially in CI) to detect
    performance regressions.
- **Test Data Management:** Strategies for generating and managing test data for various test levels
  will be defined (e.g., test data builders, setup scripts for integration tests).

### Security Best Practices

Security is paramount for ACCI EAF.

- **Authentication & Authorization (IAM Service):**
  - Strong authentication for all users and services (local users per tenant, federation via
    SAML/OIDC/LDAP, optional built-in MFA).
  - Robust RBAC and ABAC mechanisms for fine-grained access control, enforced by the IAM service and
    EAF SDKs.
  - Secure token management (e.g., JWTs) with appropriate lifetimes, signing, and validation.
- **Input Sanitization/Validation:** All external inputs (API requests, event payloads,
  user-provided data) must be rigorously validated at service boundaries (e.g., using Bean
  Validation in Spring, custom validation logic).
- **Output Encoding:** Contextual output encoding for data rendered in UIs (handled by Vaadin/Hilla
  components) and in API responses to prevent XSS.
- **Secrets Management:**
  - No hardcoded secrets. Use environment variables, Docker secrets, or a dedicated secrets
    management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault if feasible in target environments) for API keys,
    database credentials, signing keys.
  - EAF services will securely access secrets via a configuration mechanism.
- **Dependency Security:**
  - Regularly scan dependencies (both backend JVM and frontend JS/TS) for known vulnerabilities
    using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check (for scanning) and OWASP Dependency-Track (for ongoing
    monitoring of SBOMs), Snyk, or GitHub Dependabot.
  - Establish a process for timely patching of vulnerable dependencies.
- **Secure Inter-Service Communication:** All communication between EAF services (e.g., via NATS or
  internal APIs) must be over secure channels (e.g., TLS for NATS if configured, HTTPS for REST
  APIs). Authentication between services where necessary (e.g., service-to-service tokens).
- **Data Protection:**
  - Encryption of sensitive data at rest (e.g., PostgreSQL Transparent Data Encryption if
    available/applicable, or application-level encryption for specific fields).
  - Encryption of data in transit (TLS everywhere).
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Services, users, and API clients should operate with the minimum
  necessary permissions.
- **API Security:**
  - Enforce HTTPS for all APIs.
  - Implement rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse.
  - Use standard HTTP security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.) for web applications like
    the Control Plane.
- **Error Handling & Information Disclosure:** Error messages must not leak sensitive internal
  information. Detailed errors logged server-side, generic messages/error IDs to clients.
- **Auditing:** Comprehensive and secure audit trails for all critical administrative, IAM, and
  security-relevant events. Audit logs stored separately and securely.
- **Compliance Enablement:** Design with ISO27001, SOC2, and FIPS requirements in mind, facilitating
  product certification.
- **Regular Security Reviews & Testing:** Incorporate security testing (SAST, DAST, potentially
  penetration testing for mature EAF versions) into the development lifecycle.

## ArchUnit - Architectural Rule Testing

ArchUnit is a critical component of the ACCI EAF quality assurance strategy, providing automated
enforcement of architectural integrity through code analysis. It ensures that the codebase adheres
to the mandated Hexagonal Architecture, DDD principles, and established naming conventions.

### Purpose and Benefits

ArchUnit tests serve as living documentation of our architectural decisions and act as guardrails to
prevent architectural drift. They provide:

- **Automated Architecture Enforcement:** Programmatically verify that code follows Hexagonal
  Architecture layer separation
- **Continuous Compliance:** Ensure DDD principles are maintained throughout development
- **Early Violation Detection:** Catch architectural violations during development, not in code
  review
- **Documentation:** Self-documenting architectural rules that evolve with the codebase
- **Onboarding Support:** Help new developers understand and follow EAF architectural patterns

### Core Architectural Rules

#### Layer Dependency Rules (Hexagonal Architecture)

The EAF enforces strict layer separation to maintain clean architecture:

```kotlin
// Domain layer must not depend on infrastructure
ArchRuleDefinition.noClasses()
    .that().resideInAPackage("..domain..")
    .should().dependOnClassesThat().resideInAPackage("..infrastructure..")
    .because("Domain layer must not depend on infrastructure concerns")

// Domain must not depend on Spring Framework
ArchRuleDefinition.noClasses()
    .that().resideInAPackage("..domain..")
    .should().dependOnClassesThat().resideInAnyPackage("org.springframework..")
    .because("Domain layer must remain framework-agnostic")
```

#### Naming Convention Rules

Consistent naming enhances code readability and maintainability:

```kotlin
// Events should end with "Event" and be in domain.event packages
ArchRuleDefinition.classes()
    .that().haveSimpleNameEndingWith("Event")
    .should().resideInAPackage("..domain.event..")
    .because("Events should be clearly identified and properly located")

// Aggregates should end with "Aggregate" and be in domain.model packages
ArchRuleDefinition.classes()
    .that().haveSimpleNameEndingWith("Aggregate")
    .should().resideInAPackage("..domain.model..")
    .because("Aggregates are core domain concepts")
```

### Running ArchUnit Tests Locally

#### Command Line Execution

```bash
# Run all tests (including ArchUnit tests)
nx run-many -t test

# Run tests for specific module
nx test eaf-core

# Run tests with verbose output
nx test eaf-core --args="--info"

# Run only architecture tests (if using naming convention)
nx test eaf-core --args="--tests \"*ArchTest*\""
```

#### IDE Integration

ArchUnit tests run as standard JUnit 5 tests, so they integrate seamlessly with your IDE:

1. **IntelliJ IDEA:** Right-click on test classes/methods and select "Run"
2. **VS Code:** Use the Test Explorer or CodeLens "Run Test" links
3. **Command Palette:** Use "Java: Run Tests" commands

### Test Organization

#### Current Structure

```
libs/eaf-sdk/eaf-core/src/test/kotlin/com/axians/eaf/core/arch/
â”œâ”€â”€ EafArchitectureTest.kt          # Common EAF architectural rules
â””â”€â”€ SimpleArchTest.kt               # Basic validation tests

apps/iam-service/src/test/kotlin/com/axians/eaf/iam/arch/
â””â”€â”€ IamServiceArchitectureTest.kt   # Service-specific rules
```

#### Test File Naming

- Architecture test files should end with `ArchTest.kt` or `ArchitectureTest.kt`
- Place in `arch` package within the test source tree
- Use descriptive class names (e.g., `EafArchitectureTest`, `IamServiceArchitectureTest`)

### Adding New Architectural Rules

#### Step 1: Identify the Rule

Before writing a new ArchUnit rule, clearly define:

- **What** architectural constraint you want to enforce
- **Why** this constraint is important for the EAF
- **Where** the rule should be located (common EAF rules vs. service-specific)

#### Step 2: Choose the Appropriate Test Location

- **Common EAF Rules:** Add to
  `libs/eaf-sdk/eaf-core/src/test/kotlin/.../arch/EafArchitectureTest.kt`
- **Service-Specific Rules:** Add to the service's own architecture test class
- **New Service:** Create a new `{ServiceName}ArchitectureTest.kt` file

#### Step 3: Write the Rule

Use ArchUnit's fluent API to express your architectural constraint:

```kotlin
@Test
fun `application layer should not depend on infrastructure details`() {
    ArchRuleDefinition.noClasses()
        .that().resideInAPackage("..application..")
        .should().dependOnClassesThat().resideInAnyPackage(
            "jakarta.persistence..",
            "org.springframework.data.jpa..",
            "org.springframework.web.."
        )
        .because("Application layer should remain independent of infrastructure implementations")
        .check(importedClasses)
}
```

#### Step 4: Test the Rule

1. **Run the Test:** Ensure your new rule passes against the current codebase
2. **Verify Enforcement:** Intentionally violate the rule to confirm it catches violations
3. **Update Documentation:** Add your rule to this documentation if it's a common pattern

### Common ArchUnit Patterns

#### Package-Based Rules

```kotlin
// Classes in specific packages should follow conventions
ArchRuleDefinition.classes()
    .that().resideInAPackage("..application.service..")
    .should().haveSimpleNameEndingWith("Service")
    .andShould().beAnnotatedWith(org.springframework.stereotype.Service::class.java)
```

#### Annotation-Based Rules

```kotlin
// All repositories should be in infrastructure layer
ArchRuleDefinition.classes()
    .that().areAnnotatedWith(Repository::class.java)
    .should().resideInAPackage("..infrastructure.adapter.out..")
```

#### Dependency Rules

```kotlin
// Prevent circular dependencies
ArchRuleDefinition.slices()
    .matching("com.axians.eaf.(*)..")
    .should().beFreeOfCycles()
```

### Integration with CI Pipeline

ArchUnit tests are automatically executed as part of the CI pipeline:

- **GitLab CI:** Tests run during the `test` stage via `npx nx run-many --target=test --all`
- **GitHub Actions:** Tests run in the `test` job with the same command
- **Failure Handling:** Any ArchUnit test failure will cause the entire build to fail

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### "No classes found" Errors

This typically happens when:

- Package names in rules don't match actual package structure
- Classes haven't been compiled yet (run `nx run eaf-core:compileKotlin` first)

#### Performance Issues

- Use `allowEmptyShould(true)` for rules that might not find matching classes in MVP state
- Consider using more specific package patterns to reduce the scope of analysis

#### False Positives

- Review package naming conventions
- Check if generated code should be excluded from analysis
- Consider using `ignoreDependency()` for acceptable violations

### Best Practices

1. **Start Simple:** Begin with basic layer dependency rules before adding complex constraints
2. **Clear Messaging:** Always include a meaningful `because()` clause explaining the rule's purpose
3. **Regular Review:** Periodically review and update rules as the architecture evolves
4. **Team Agreement:** Ensure all team members understand and agree with architectural rules
5. **Incremental Addition:** Add new rules gradually to avoid overwhelming the team

### Future Enhancements

As the EAF matures, consider adding:

- **Complexity Rules:** Enforce maximum cyclomatic complexity
- **Size Rules:** Limit class/method sizes
- **Dependency Direction:** Ensure dependencies flow in the correct direction
- **API Rules:** Enforce public API design constraints
