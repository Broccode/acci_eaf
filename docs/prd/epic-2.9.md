**Epic 2.9: Control Plane API Foundation & Production Readiness**

- **Goal:** Establish a production-ready Control Plane backend service with comprehensive IAM
  integration, Hilla endpoints for type-safe frontend communication, and advanced administrative
  features that demonstrate the full capabilities of the ACCI EAF platform.

- **User Stories:**

  1. **Story 2.9.1: Control Plane Backend Service Foundation**

     - As an EAF Developer, I want to create a properly structured Control Plane backend service
       using Spring Boot and Hilla that integrates seamlessly with all EAF core services, so that we
       have a solid foundation for administrative functionality with type-safe frontend
       communication.
     - **Acceptance Criteria:**
       1. A new `apps/acci-eaf-control-plane` service is created following EAF hexagonal
          architecture patterns.
       2. The service is configured with Hilla for type-safe TypeScript client generation and
          @BrowserCallable endpoint support.
       3. Integration with `eaf-iam-client` SDK provides proper authentication and tenant context
          propagation.
       4. Integration with `eaf-eventing-sdk` enables event publishing for administrative actions.
       5. Health check endpoints and operational monitoring are configured.
       6. The service successfully starts and generates TypeScript client definitions for frontend
          consumption.

  2. **Story 2.9.2: Complete IAM Service Integration & Advanced User Management**

     - As a Control Plane Administrator, I want comprehensive user and tenant management
       capabilities that properly integrate with the EAF IAM service, so that I can efficiently
       manage all aspects of user identity and access control across the platform.
     - **Acceptance Criteria:**
       1. **Enhanced Tenant Management**: @BrowserCallable Hilla endpoints provide complete tenant
          CRUD operations (create, read, update, archive) with proper validation and error handling.
       2. **Advanced User Management**: Endpoints support user lifecycle management including
          creation, role assignment, password reset, account activation/deactivation, and bulk
          operations.
       3. **Role & Permission Management**: Endpoints allow dynamic role creation, permission
          assignment, and role-based access control configuration at both platform and tenant
          levels.
       4. **User Invitation Flow**: Complete invitation workflow including email notifications,
          secure invitation links, and first-time password setup.
       5. **Audit Trail Integration**: All administrative actions are logged with proper context
          (admin user, tenant, timestamp, action details) for compliance and troubleshooting.
       6. **Multi-tenant Security**: All operations enforce strict tenant isolation with proper
          authorization checks.

  3. **Story 2.9.3: License Management & System Configuration APIs**

     - As a SuperAdmin, I want comprehensive license management and system configuration
       capabilities through the Control Plane, so that I can manage software licensing, feature
       flags, and system-wide configuration efficiently.
     - **Acceptance Criteria:**
       1. **License Management**: @BrowserCallable endpoints provide complete license lifecycle
          management (creation, activation, validation, renewal, revocation) with hardware binding
          support.
       2. **Feature Flag Management**: Endpoints allow creation, modification, and tenant-specific
          configuration of feature flags with rollout controls.
       3. **System Configuration**: Endpoints provide secure management of system-wide configuration
          settings with validation and rollback capabilities.
       4. **Usage Monitoring**: APIs provide license usage statistics, feature flag evaluation
          metrics, and system health indicators.
       5. **Integration APIs**: Proper integration with EAF License Management Service and Feature
          Flag Service through their respective client SDKs.
       6. **Configuration Validation**: All configuration changes are validated for consistency and
          safety before application.

  4. **Story 2.9.4: Production Security, Error Handling & Operational Readiness**

     - As an Operations Team member, I want the Control Plane backend to implement production-grade
       security, comprehensive error handling, and operational monitoring, so that it can be safely
       deployed and maintained in production environments.
     - **Acceptance Criteria:**
       1. **Security Hardening**: Implementation of CSRF protection, secure headers, input
          sanitization, and protection against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
       2. **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based authentication with proper session
          management, role-based endpoint protection, and secure logout functionality.
       3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with user-friendly error messages,
          detailed logging for debugging, and proper HTTP status codes.
       4. **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs with detailed validation error
          responses for frontend consumption.
       5. **Rate Limiting**: Implementation of rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse and
          ensure system stability.
       6. **Monitoring Integration**: Structured logging, metrics collection, and health check
          endpoints for operational monitoring and alerting.
       7. **API Documentation**: Complete OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generated for all endpoints
          with examples and error responses.

  5. **Story 2.9.5: Event-Driven Architecture & Integration Testing**
     - As an EAF System Architect, I want the Control Plane to demonstrate proper event-driven
       architecture patterns and have comprehensive integration testing, so that it serves as a
       reference implementation for EAF best practices.
     - **Acceptance Criteria:**
       1. **Event Publishing**: All significant administrative actions (tenant creation, user
          changes, license updates) publish appropriate domain events to NATS using the EAF eventing
          SDK.
       2. **Event Consumption**: Implementation of projectors or event handlers that respond to
          relevant system events (e.g., updating administrative dashboards, triggering
          notifications).
       3. **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive integration tests that validate end-to-end
          functionality including IAM service communication, NATS event flow, and database
          operations.
       4. **Test Data Management**: Proper test data setup and cleanup with tenant isolation for
          integration tests.
       5. **Performance Testing**: Load testing of critical administrative operations with
          performance benchmarks and optimization.
       6. **Contract Testing**: API contract testing to ensure compatibility between backend and
          frontend interfaces.
       7. **Deployment Testing**: Automated deployment validation in test environments with smoke
          tests and health checks.
