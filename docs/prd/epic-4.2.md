**Epic 4.2: Security Context Evolution**

- **Goal**: Eliminate the circular dependency by refactoring the security aspect to be event-driven
  and implementing a robust context propagation mechanism.

- **User Stories**:

  - **[4.2.1](./../stories/4.2.1.story.md)**: ✅ Implement `SecurityContextCorrelationDataProvider`
    **(COMPLETED)**
  - **[4.2.2a](./../stories/4.2.2a.story.md)**: ✅ Core Request Context Extraction **(COMPLETED)**
  - **[4.2.2b](./../stories/4.2.2b.story.md)**: ✅ Advanced Request Context & Security
    **(COMPLETED)**
  - **[4.2.3](./../stories/4.2.3.story.md)**: ✅ Refactor `TenantSecurityAspect` **(COMPLETED)**
  - **[4.2.4](./../stories/4.2.4.story.md)**: ✅ Create Integration Tests for Security Context
    **(COMPLETED)**

**Note**: Story 4.2.2 was split into 4.2.2a (core functionality) and 4.2.2b (advanced features) for
better iteration management and incremental value delivery.

- **✅ Acceptance Criteria VALIDATED**:
  1. ✅ The application starts successfully with zero circular dependency exceptions and without
     requiring `@Lazy` workarounds.
  2. ✅ All events stored in the event store are verifiably enriched with `tenant_id`, `user_id`,
     and `correlation_id` from the security context.
  3. ✅ The refactored `TenantSecurityAspect` correctly enforces all previous security access rules.
