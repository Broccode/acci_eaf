## Styling Approach

Vaadin's Lumo theme will be customized to reflect Axians' branding (colors, typography, spacing) using CSS custom properties. Custom React components will utilize **CSS Modules** for scoped styling to prevent conflicts and ensure maintainability, aligning with Hilla project structures. Utility classes may be used sparingly if a utility CSS framework is adopted alongside.
