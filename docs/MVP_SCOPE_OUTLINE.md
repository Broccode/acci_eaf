**ACCI EAF - MVP Scope Outline**

**1. Overarching MVP Goal:**

The overarching goal of the ACCI EAF MVP is to **deliver a stable, documented, and usable core framework that empowers a pilot Axians development team to successfully build and deploy a representative service or application module using Kotlin/Spring, strictly adhering to CQRS/ES, DDD, Hexagonal Architecture, and TDD principles. This MVP must demonstrate core multi-tenancy with basic IAM (RBAC), utilize the foundational developer tooling (including CI/CD with quality gates), and validate the core technical viability (NATS, PostgreSQL for Event Sourcing) and improved developer experience of the EAF.**

**2. Prioritized MVP Epics & Core Deliverables:**

**2.1. Epic: Foundational Engineering & DevEx Setup (MVP)**

* **Goal:** Establish the core development environment, CI/CD practices, and quality gates necessary for building ACCI EAF and its applications according to mandated principles.
* **Core "Must-Have" Functionalities:**
  * Selected monorepo tool (e.g., Nx) initialized with basic backend (Kotlin/Spring) and frontend (TBD UI) module structures.
  * Basic CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) integrating linters (Spotless for Kotlin, Prettier/ESLint for UI), code formatters, and automated unit test execution for initial modules.
  * Functional TDD setup for both Kotlin/Spring (JUnit/MockK) and the chosen frontend framework, with example tests.
  * Initial structure for the "Launchpad" Developer Portal (e.g., using Docusaurus) established.
* **High-Level User Stories / Key Demonstrable Outcomes:**
    1. *"As a Developer (e.g., Majlinda, Michael), I want the ACCI EAF monorepo to be initialized with clear, standardized project structures for Kotlin/Spring backend services and the chosen UI framework, so that I can easily navigate, manage, and contribute code for different EAF modules and product components from day one."*
    2. *"As a Developer (e.g., Lirika, Majlinda), I want an automated Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline that runs linters, code formatters, and all unit tests on every commit to the `main` branch, so that code quality and consistency are automatically enforced and I receive fast feedback on my changes."*
    3. *"As a Developer (e.g., Michael, Majlinda, Lirika), I want a functional Test-Driven Design (TDD) setup readily available for both Kotlin/Spring and the chosen UI framework, complete with integrated testing libraries and illustrative example tests, so that I can easily practice and strictly adhere to TDD for all new ACCI EAF code."*
    4. *"As an EAF Contributor/User (e.g., Anita, Michael), I want the initial structure for the 'Launchpad' Developer Portal to be established and accessible, so that foundational documentation, architectural principles, and 'getting started' guides can be populated and consumed as the first EAF components are developed."*

**2.2. Epic: Core Eventing Backbone (NATS-based) - MVP**

* **Goal:** Provide a reliable and usable eventing system for EDA and CQRS/ES within ACCI EAF.

    3. *"As an Architect (e.g., Fred, Michael), I want the Event Store's underlying PostgreSQL schema and the ACCI EAF SDK to enforce strict data isolation for all stored events based on `tenant_id`, ensuring that event data for one tenant is never accessible to or mixed with that of another."*
    4. *"As a Backend Developer (e.g., Majlinda), I want the ACCI EAF SDK to provide clear patterns and basic support for storing and retrieving aggregate snapshots in conjunction with the event stream, so that I have a mechanism to optimize rehydration times for aggregates with very long event histories."*

    2. *"As an Axians Operator deploying ACCI EAF for a customer who initially only needs a single-tenant setup, I want a simple, streamlined process to initialize the EAF with a default Superadmin, a default tenant, and the Superadmin assigned as the Tenant Administrator for that tenant, so the system is quickly usable."*
    3. *"As a Tenant Administrator, I want to use the Control Plane MVP to create and manage local users (e.g., set initial passwords, activate/deactivate) exclusively for my tenant, so I can control user access to applications within my tenant."*
    4. *"As a Backend Developer (e.g., Majlinda), I want to use the ACCI EAF IAM SDK to easily authenticate local users against their specific tenant and to enforce basic Role-Based Access Control (based on a few pre-defined application roles) for these users, so that I can protect application resources."*
    5. *"As an ACCI EAF service/component, I need reliable access to the current `tenant_id` and basic user context from the IAM system (e.g., via validated tokens or an SDK utility), so I can enforce tenant data isolation and make context-aware decisions."*

  * The pilot team successfully uses the ACCI EAF MVP (core services, SDKs, CLI, Dev Portal, mandated principles) to build and deploy this service/module.
  * The pilot successfully demonstrates key EAF MVP capabilities (basic multi-tenancy, IAM with RBAC, event sourcing, Eventing Bus usage, TDD/DDD/Hexagonal adherence).
  * Feedback from the pilot team on EAF MVP usability, documentation, and tooling is collected and analyzed.
