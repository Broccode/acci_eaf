**Project Brief: ACCI EAF (Axians Competence Center Infrastructure - Enterprise Application Framework)**

**1. Project Overview & Vision**

* **Brief Description:**
  * ACCI EAF is a new, modern Enterprise Application Framework being developed by Axians to serve as the foundational platform for building and evolving its current and future software products (e.g., DPCM, ZEWSSP, and a planned combined VMWare/IBM Power management tool).
  * It will provide a comprehensive suite of core services, application development accelerators, and robust developer tooling, emphasizing modern architectural patterns, security, multi-tenancy, and developer experience.

* **Problem Statement / Opportunity:**
  * The current framework (DCA) suffers from significant limitations: it's outdated, has accumulated technical debt (e.g., manual ORM, JSON blob storage), lacks crucial features like proper multi-tenancy and robust testing ("zero tests"), and its manual code sharing process makes updates difficult, leading to instability and a challenging developer experience ("breaks often," "hard to understand data flow").
  * These issues hinder rapid innovation, product quality, maintainability, and the ability to meet evolving customer needs, particularly for clients requiring high security, compliance (ISO27001, SOC2, FIPS), and strong data isolation (e.g., financial institutions, "Chinese wall" scenarios).
  * **Opportunity:** ACCI EAF presents an opportunity to replace DCA with a future-proof platform that will:
    * Drastically improve developer productivity and satisfaction.
    * Enhance product quality, stability, and security.
    * Enable faster time-to-market for new products and features.
    * Support advanced architectural patterns (CQRS/ES, DDD, Hexagonal Architecture).
    * Provide core capabilities like robust multi-tenancy, advanced IAM (RBAC/ABAC), license management, and comprehensive i18n, directly meeting critical business and customer requirements.

* **Project Goals & Objectives:**
  * **Primary Goal:** Deliver a stable, secure, maintainable, and highly usable Enterprise Application Framework that accelerates the development of high-quality, multi-tenant software products at Axians.
  * **Key Objectives:**
        1. Replace the legacy DCA framework for new product development and provide a clear path for modernizing existing products where feasible.
        2. Implement robust multi-tenancy and advanced IAM (RBAC/ABAC) as core, non-negotiable features.
        3. Provide comprehensive developer tooling, SDKs, and documentation to ensure an excellent Developer Experience, supporting mandatory TDD, DDD, and Hexagonal Architecture principles.
        4. Ensure compatibility with critical infrastructure (e.g., `ppc64le`, `corenode` integration for DPCM) and customer environments ("less cloud-native").
        5. Support crucial business needs such as integrated License Management and strong compliance features (SBOM, auditability for ISO27001/SOC2).
        6. Establish a modern, consistent architectural foundation based on CQRS/Event Sourcing and an Event-Driven Architecture.

* **Vision for the Solution:**
  * ACCI EAF will be the preferred, high-quality, secure, and developer-friendly platform that empowers Axians to efficiently build innovative, enterprise-grade software solutions. It will be recognized for its stability, its comprehensive feature set, its adherence to modern best practices, and for making the development process at Axians a benchmark of excellence.
  * It will enable Axians to confidently address sophisticated customer requirements and expand its product offerings in the data center management and enterprise software space.

The emphasis is on robust, maintainable, and appropriately scalable open-source solutions where possible, supporting the core architectural patterns and non-functional requirements.

* **Eventing Bus:**
  * **Favored Candidate:** **NATS with JetStream.**
  * **Rationale:** Appears to offer a good balance of performance, simplicity of operation, robust persistence, ordered delivery, strong multi-tenancy primitives (via NATS Accounts), and `ppc64le` compatibility.
  * **Further Investigation:** Detailed evaluation of its ecosystem for schema management, advanced error handling patterns, and operational characteristics.

* **Event Store:**
  * **Favored Approach:** Utilizing **PostgreSQL** as the underlying persistent storage.
  * **Rationale:** Leverages existing team familiarity, proven reliability, ACID compliance, strong `ppc64le` support.
  * **EAF Responsibility:** ACCI EAF will provide a comprehensive SDK/library layer (likely in Kotlin/Spring) on top of PostgreSQL to implement all necessary event sourcing semantics.
  * **Note:** Axon Server was considered but is not favored for the Event Store due to commercial licensing constraints.

* **Backend Core Services (IAM, Licensing, Config, Product Backends):**
  * **Strong Inclination:** **Kotlin with Spring Boot 3 and Spring Framework 6.**
  * **Rationale:** Modern, concise language with excellent JVM and Spring ecosystem support, strong enterprise adoption, comprehensive features (including Spring Security), excellent `ppc64le` support via the JVM, good integration capabilities.
  * **CQRS/ES Pattern Implementation:** **Axon Framework** (the open-source library) is considered a valuable tool for implementing CQRS/ES patterns within these Kotlin/Spring services.

* **UI Framework Strategy:**
  * **Approach:** A **single, modern JavaScript/TypeScript UI framework** will be selected.
  * **Specific Framework:** To Be Determined (TBD) after further evaluation.
  * **Key Requirements for Selection:** Strong component model, excellent i18n support, Storybook compatibility, performance, robust state management, supportive ecosystem.

* **Monorepo Tooling:**
  * **Candidate for Investigation:** **Nx** (due to its comprehensive features and potential for multi-language support) or similar tools like Turborepo, layered on top of package manager workspaces (e.g., Yarn, PNPM).
  * **Rationale:** To manage the ACCI EAF codebase, shared libraries, and product applications efficiently.
