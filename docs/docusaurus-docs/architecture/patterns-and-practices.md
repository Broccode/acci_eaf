# Patterns & Practices in EAF

This guide consolidates proven patterns and best practices for developing services within the ACCI
EAF ecosystem.

## 🎯 Core Patterns

Essential patterns that form the foundation of EAF development.

### Aggregate Pattern

Aggregates encapsulate business rules and maintain consistency boundaries.

### Repository Pattern

Repositories provide clean abstractions for data access.

### Factory Pattern

Factories handle complex object creation logic.

### Strategy Pattern

Strategies enable flexible algorithm selection.

## 🏗️ Architectural Practices

### Service Boundaries

Define clear service boundaries aligned with business capabilities.

### Event Design

Design events for evolution and backward compatibility.

### Configuration Management

Externalize configuration for different environments.

### Error Handling

Implement consistent error handling across all layers.

## 🧪 Testing Practices

### Test Pyramid

Follow the test pyramid with appropriate test distribution.

### Test Isolation

Ensure tests are isolated and deterministic.

### Test Data Management

Use builders and factories for test data creation.

## 📊 Performance Patterns

### Caching Strategies

Implement appropriate caching at different layers.

### Async Processing

Use asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations.

### Database Optimization

Optimize database queries and indexing strategies.

## 🔒 Security Practices

### Authentication & Authorization

Implement consistent security patterns across services.

### Input Validation

Validate all inputs at service boundaries.

### Audit Logging

Maintain comprehensive audit trails.

## 🔗 Integration Patterns

### Circuit Breaker

Implement circuit breakers for external service calls.

### Retry Policies

Define consistent retry strategies.

### Bulkhead Pattern

Isolate critical resources.
