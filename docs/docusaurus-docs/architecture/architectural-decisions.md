# Architectural Decisions in EAF

This document captures key architectural decisions made for the ACCI EAF framework, providing
context and rationale for major design choices.

## ðŸŽ¯ Decision Overview

Each architectural decision record (ADR) follows a structured format documenting the context,
decision, and consequences.

## ðŸ“‹ Decision Records

### ADR-001: Hexagonal Architecture Pattern

**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need for clean separation of business logic from infrastructure concerns  
**Decision**: Adopt hexagonal architecture with ports and adapters  
**Consequences**: Improved testability and maintainability

### ADR-002: Event-Driven Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Requirement for loose coupling and scalability  
**Decision**: Use NATS for event messaging between services  
**Consequences**: Enhanced scalability but increased complexity

### ADR-003: PostgreSQL as Event Store

**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need for ACID compliance in event sourcing  
**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL for event storage instead of specialized stores  
**Consequences**: Simplified operations but potentially limited event store features

### ADR-004: Spring Boot Framework

**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need for enterprise-grade framework with ecosystem  
**Decision**: Standardize on Spring Boot for all services  
**Consequences**: Rich ecosystem and tooling but framework coupling

### ADR-005: Domain-Driven Design Patterns

**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Complex business domains requiring clear modeling  
**Decision**: Enforce DDD tactical patterns in all services  
**Consequences**: Better domain understanding but steeper learning curve

## ðŸ”„ Decision Process

All architectural decisions follow a structured review process with stakeholder input and technical
validation.
