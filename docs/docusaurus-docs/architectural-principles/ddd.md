# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in ACCI EAF

Domain-Driven Design is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration between technical teams and domain experts to create a model that accurately reflects the business domain.

## Key Concepts

### Aggregates

Aggregates are the core building blocks of your domain model. In ACCI EAF:

- Each aggregate is responsible for maintaining its own consistency
- Aggregates are the unit of persistence in our Event Store
- Cross-aggregate communication happens through domain events

### Domain Events

Events represent something important that happened in the domain:

```kotlin
data class TenantCreatedEvent(
    val tenantId: TenantId,
    val tenantName: String,
    val adminEmail: String,
    val timestamp: Instant
) : DomainEvent
```

### Value Objects

Immutable objects that represent domain concepts:

```kotlin
@JvmInline
value class TenantId(val value: UUID)

data class EmailAddress(val value: String) {
    init {
        require(value.contains("@")) { "Invalid email format" }
    }
}
```

### Bounded Contexts

ACCI EAF organizes functionality into distinct bounded contexts:

- **IAM Context**: User and tenant management
- **Licensing Context**: Software license management
- **Feature Flag Context**: Feature toggle management

## EAF-Specific Guidelines

### Aggregate Design

- Keep aggregates small and focused
- Use the EAF Event Sourcing SDK for persistence
- Implement optimistic concurrency control
- Emit events for all state changes

### Repository Pattern

- Use repository interfaces as ports in Hexagonal Architecture
- Implement repositories as adapters in the infrastructure layer
- Leverage the EAF Event Store SDK

### Domain Services

- Place complex business logic that doesn't belong to a single aggregate
- Keep domain services pure and testable
- Inject dependencies through constructor
