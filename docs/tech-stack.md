## Definitive Tech Stack Selections

These selections are based on the PRD's \"Core Technical Decisions & Application Structure\" and
further refined for this architectural document. Versions should be pinned during initial project
setup and managed via **centralized dependency version management** in the root `build.gradle.kts`
and `package.json`. See `docs/troubleshooting/dependency-management-guidelines.md` for details.
