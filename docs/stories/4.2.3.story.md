# Story 4.2.3: Refactor TenantSecurityAspect

## Status: To Do

## Story
- **As a** Developer
- **I want** to refactor the `TenantSecurityAspect` to completely remove its dependency on the `AuditService`
- **so that** I can break the circular dependency at its source.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The constructor for `TenantSecurityAspect` no longer injects `AuditService`.
2. All direct calls to `auditService.logAdminAction(...)` are removed from the aspect.
3. The aspect's sole responsibilities are now access validation and enriching the MDC logging context.
4. The application context starts successfully without any `BeanCurrentlyInCreationException`.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Analyze Current TenantSecurityAspect Dependencies** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Review current `TenantSecurityAspect` constructor and dependencies
  - [ ] Document all locations where `AuditService` is currently used
  - [ ] Identify the specific audit logging patterns that need replacement
  - [ ] Map current security validation logic to ensure preservation
  - [ ] Document MDC context enrichment patterns currently in use

- [ ] **Task 2: Remove AuditService Dependency** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Remove `AuditService` from `TenantSecurityAspect` constructor parameters
  - [ ] Delete all `auditService.logAdminAction(...)` calls from the aspect
  - [ ] Remove any audit-related imports and references
  - [ ] Clean up any audit-related private methods in the aspect
  - [ ] Ensure aspect focuses solely on access control and MDC enrichment

- [ ] **Task 3: Preserve Security Validation Logic** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Maintain all existing tenant access validation logic
  - [ ] Preserve role-based authorization checks
  - [ ] Keep permission validation for sensitive operations
  - [ ] Ensure security context validation remains intact
  - [ ] Maintain exception throwing for unauthorized access attempts

- [ ] **Task 4: Enhance MDC Logging Context** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Expand MDC context with additional security metadata
  - [ ] Add tenant information to logging context
  - [ ] Include user ID and roles in MDC for comprehensive logging
  - [ ] Add request correlation data to MDC context
  - [ ] Ensure proper MDC cleanup after aspect execution

- [ ] **Task 5: Replace Audit Logging with Event Publishing**
  - [ ] Create `SecurityAuditEvent` domain events for security actions
  - [ ] Publish security events instead of direct audit service calls
  - [ ] Include all necessary audit information in security events
  - [ ] Ensure events contain sufficient context for audit trail reconstruction
  - [ ] Use Axon event publishing for decoupled audit logging

- [ ] **Task 6: Application Context Startup Verification** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Test application startup without circular dependency errors
  - [ ] Verify all Spring beans initialize correctly
  - [ ] Confirm aspect weaving works properly after refactoring
  - [ ] Test security functionality remains intact
  - [ ] Validate that no functionality is lost in the refactoring

- [ ] **Task 7: Update Integration Tests and Documentation**
  - [ ] Update existing tests that depend on audit service interaction
  - [ ] Create new tests for event-based audit trail
  - [ ] Document the new security event publishing pattern
  - [ ] Update architectural documentation to reflect changes
  - [ ] Create migration guide for other aspects following similar patterns

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Module Location**: Existing `TenantSecurityAspect` class location (likely in security or infrastructure package)
- **Dependencies to Remove**: 
  ```kotlin
  // REMOVE THIS:
  class TenantSecurityAspect(
      private val auditService: AuditService  // <- Remove this dependency
  )
  ```
- **Dependencies to Add**: Add to relevant build.gradle.kts:
  ```kotlin
  implementation(libs.axon.messaging)  // For event publishing
  implementation(libs.micrometer.core)  // For metrics if needed
  ```
- **Event-Driven Audit Pattern**: Replace direct audit calls with event publishing:
  ```kotlin
  // Instead of: auditService.logAdminAction(...)
  // Use: eventGateway.publish(SecurityAuditEvent(...))
  ```
- **MDC Context Enhancement**: Use structured logging with meaningful context:
  ```kotlin
  MDC.put("tenant_id", tenantId)
  MDC.put("user_id", userId)
  MDC.put("action", "security_validation")
  ```
- **Aspect Responsibility Separation**: Focus on single responsibility principle:
  - **Keep**: Access validation, authorization checks, MDC enrichment
  - **Remove**: Direct audit logging, complex business logic
  - **Add**: Security event publishing
- **Spring Configuration**: Ensure proper aspect ordering and configuration
- **Error Handling**: Maintain existing security exception patterns

## Testing Guidance

- **Objective**: Verify refactored aspect maintains security functionality while eliminating circular dependencies
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  - **Application Startup Tests**:
    - Test successful Spring context initialization
    - Verify no `BeanCurrentlyInCreationException` errors
    - Confirm all beans load in correct order
    - Test aspect weaving and proxy creation
  - **Security Functionality Tests**:
    - Verify tenant access validation still works correctly
    - Test role-based authorization enforcement
    - Confirm security exceptions are thrown appropriately
    - Test MDC context enrichment functionality
  - **Event Publishing Tests**:
    - Verify security events are published correctly
    - Test event content includes all necessary audit information
    - Confirm event publishing doesn't block security validation
    - Test event publishing failure handling
  - **Integration Tests**:
    - End-to-end security validation through aspect
    - Test aspect interaction with other security components
    - Verify logging output includes proper MDC context
    - Test performance impact of event publishing
  - **Regression Tests**:
    - Ensure no existing security functionality is broken
    - Verify all security validations continue to work
    - Test error scenarios and exception handling
    - Confirm aspect ordering and execution sequence
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - Application starts successfully without circular dependency errors
  - All existing security validations continue to function
  - Security events provide complete audit trail information
  - No performance degradation in security validation
  - MDC logging context includes comprehensive security metadata
- **Circular Dependency Validation**:
  - Spring context graph analysis shows no cycles
  - Bean creation order is deterministic
  - No lazy initialization required for core security components
- **Audit Trail Completeness**:
  - All security actions generate appropriate events
  - Event data sufficient for regulatory compliance
  - Audit trail reconstruction possible from events
- **Tools**: JUnit 5, Spring Boot Test, Axon Test Framework, Spring context analysis tools, MockK for aspect testing
