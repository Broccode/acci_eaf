# Story 2.7.3: UI Foundation Kit & Storybook Access via Launchpad

## Status: Completed

## Story

- **As a** Frontend Developer (Lirika)
- **I want** "The Launchpad" to provide easy access to an interactive UI component library (Storybook instance) for the ACCI EAF UI Foundation Kit MVP, showcasing available Vaadin and custom React components, their props, variations, and usage examples (including Hilla integration)
- **so that** I can easily discover and reuse standardized UI components in my applications.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **✅ Launchpad Integration**: "The Launchpad" has a clear section or prominent link pointing to the deployed Storybook instance for the ACCI EAF UI Foundation Kit.
2. **✅ Core Component Coverage**: The Storybook instance includes entries for the initial set of core generic components (Buttons, Inputs, Layouts, Tables, Modals, etc.) from the UI Foundation Kit, as defined by the Design Architect.
3. **✅ Interactive Stories**: Each Storybook entry provides interactive controls to manipulate component props, clear code snippets for usage in React/Hilla, and notes on theming and accessibility.
4. **✅ Hilla Integration Examples**: Usage examples explicitly demonstrate how to integrate the components within a Hilla-powered React frontend.
5. **✅ Accessibility Compliance**: All components in the Storybook meet basic accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 A/AA).

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story establishes the design system's technical foundation by creating a reusable UI component library and making it discoverable through Storybook on "The Launchpad".

### 1. Project Setup: UI Foundation Kit

**Location**: A new library within the Nx workspace, e.g., `libs/ui-foundation-kit`.

**Generator**: Use the `@nx/react:library` generator to create the library.

```bash
nx generate @nx/react:library ui-foundation-kit --publishable --importPath=@acci-eaf/ui-foundation-kit
```

**Technology Stack**:

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Component Base**: Vaadin React Components (e.g., `@vaadin/react-components`)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- **State Management**: Hilla for frontend-backend communication.

### 2. Storybook Setup and Configuration

**Installation**: Add Storybook to the `ui-foundation-kit` library.

```bash
npx storybook@latest init
```

Follow the prompts to configure Storybook for a React + TypeScript project.

**Configuration (`libs/ui-foundation-kit/.storybook/main.ts`)**:

- Ensure addons for interactivity, accessibility, and documentation are included:

    ```typescript
    import type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/react-vite';

    const config: StorybookConfig = {
      stories: ['../src/lib/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx|mdx)'],
      addons: [
        '@storybook/addon-essentials',
        '@storybook/addon-interactions',
        '@storybook/addon-a11y', // For accessibility checks
      ],
      framework: {
        name: '@storybook/react-vite',
        options: {
          builder: {
            viteConfigPath: 'vite.config.ts',
          },
        },
      },
    };

    export default config;
    ```

- Configure Tailwind CSS integration with Storybook.

### 3. Core Component Implementation

Implement the initial set of core components within the `ui-foundation-kit` library.

**Component Structure Example (`libs/ui-foundation-kit/src/lib/button/button.tsx`)**:

```tsx
import { Button as VaadinButton, ButtonProps } from '@vaadin/react-components/Button';
import React from 'react';

export interface CustomButtonProps extends ButtonProps {
  // Add custom props if needed
}

export const Button: React.FC<CustomButtonProps> = (props) => {
  return <VaadinButton {...props} />;
};
```

### 4. Story Creation Standards

For each component, create a corresponding `.stories.tsx` file.

**Story Structure Example (`libs/ui-foundation-kit/src/lib/button/button.stories.tsx`)**:

```tsx
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';
import { Button } from './button';

const meta: Meta<typeof Button> = {
  component: Button,
  title: 'Components/Button',
  tags: ['autodocs'],
  argTypes: {
    theme: {
      control: 'select',
      options: ['primary', 'secondary', 'tertiary', 'contrast'],
    },
    disabled: {
      control: 'boolean',
    },
    children: {
      control: 'text',
    },
  },
  args: {
    children: 'Click me',
    disabled: false,
  },
};
export default meta;

type Story = StoryObj<typeof Button>;

export const Primary: Story = {
  args: {
    theme: 'primary',
  },
};

export const Secondary: Story = {
  args: {
    theme: 'secondary',
  },
};

export const WithHillaIntegration: Story = {
  render: (args) => {
    // const { data, error } = SomeEndpoint.use(); // Example Hilla endpoint
    return (
      <div>
        <p>This example shows how the button could trigger a Hilla endpoint.</p>
        <Button {...args} onClick={() => alert('Endpoint called!')} />
      </div>
    );
  },
  args: {
    theme: 'primary',
    children: 'Call Endpoint',
  },
};
```

### 5. Launchpad Integration

**Action**: Add a direct link to the deployed Storybook instance in the main navigation of "The Launchpad".

**Location**: `docs/docusaurus.config.js`

**Implementation**:

```javascript
// ...
  themeConfig: {
    navbar: {
      title: 'ACCI EAF Launchpad',
      // ...
      items: [
        {
          type: 'doc',
          docId: 'intro',
          position: 'left',
          label: 'Docs',
        },
        // Add this new item
        {
          href: 'https://storybook.your-domain.com', // Replace with actual Storybook URL
          label: 'Component Library',
          position: 'left',
        },
        // ...
      ],
    },
// ...
```

### 6. Deployment Strategy

**Plan**: Deploy the Storybook instance as a static site.

- **CI/CD**: Create a new pipeline in the CI/CD system (e.g., GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) for the `ui-foundation-kit` library.
- **Build Command**: `nx build-storybook ui-foundation-kit`
- **Hosting**: Host the output from `dist/storybook/ui-foundation-kit` on a static hosting provider (e.g., GitLab Pages, Vercel, Netlify).
- **URL**: The deployment should be available at a stable, predictable URL to be linked from "The Launchpad".

### Change Log

- **Created**: [Current Date] - Initial story creation.

## Notes

**Success Metrics**:

- A frontend developer can find and understand a component's usage in under 3 minutes.
- The number of custom, one-off components in feature development decreases over time.
- The Storybook link is one of the top 5 most-clicked external links from The Launchpad.

**Dependencies**:

- A clear UI design for the core components from the Design Architect.
- Access to a static hosting environment for the Storybook deployment.

**Risk Mitigation**:

- **Component Complexity**: Start with a minimal set of core components and expand iteratively.
- **Deployment Issues**: Test the deployment pipeline early in the process.
- **Design-Dev Misalignment**: Hold regular syncs with the Design Architect to ensure components match the visual and functional specifications.
