# Story 4.6.1: Create Monitoring Dashboard for Axon Metrics

## Status: To Do

## Story
- **As a** DevOps Engineer
- **I want** to create a Grafana dashboard to visualize key Axon metrics
- **so that** I can monitor the health and performance of the event-driven system in real-time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Axon's Micrometer module is added as a dependency.
2. The application is configured to expose Prometheus metrics.
3. A new Grafana dashboard is created.
4. The dashboard visualizes key metrics, including but not limited to:
   - Command bus throughput and latency.
   - Event processor latency (lag).
   - Event store write/read performance.
   - NATS event publishing rate and error rate.
5. Alerts are configured for critical conditions, such as high event processor lag or a spike in command failures.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Configuration Location**: `apps/acci-eaf-control-plane/src/main/resources/application.yml`
- **Dashboard Location**: Create `infra/monitoring/grafana/axon-system-dashboard.json`
- **Dependencies Required**: Add to build.gradle.kts:
  ```kotlin
  implementation(libs.axon.micrometer)
  implementation(libs.spring.boot.starter.actuator)
  implementation(libs.micrometer.registry.prometheus)
  implementation(libs.micrometer.core)
  ```
- **Axon Metrics Configuration**:
  ```yaml
  axon:
    metrics:
      auto-configuration:
        enabled: true
      micrometer:
        enabled: true
        dimensional: true
  
  management:
    endpoints:
      web:
        exposure:
          include: prometheus,health,info,metrics
    endpoint:
      prometheus:
        enabled: true
    metrics:
      export:
        prometheus:
          enabled: true
          step: 15s
  ```
- **Custom Metrics Example**:
  ```kotlin
  @Component
  class EafCustomMetrics(meterRegistry: MeterRegistry) {
      private val eventProcessingLag = Timer.builder("eaf.event.processing.lag")
          .register(meterRegistry)
      
      private val tenantEventCounter = Counter.builder("eaf.events.by.tenant")
          .tag("tenant", "")
          .register(meterRegistry)
  }
  ```
- **Dashboard Panel Examples**:
  - Command throughput: `rate(axon_command_bus_commands_total[5m])`
  - Event processor lag: `axon_event_processor_lag_seconds`
  - Event store write latency: `histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(axon_event_store_write_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))`
  - NATS publish rate: `rate(nats_publish_total[5m])`
- **Alert Rule Examples**:
  ```yaml
  - alert: HighEventProcessorLag
    expr: axon_event_processor_lag_seconds > 30
    for: 2m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Event processor lag is high"
  
  - alert: HighCommandFailureRate
    expr: rate(axon_command_bus_failures_total[5m]) / rate(axon_command_bus_commands_total[5m]) > 0.05
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: critical
  ```
- **Grafana Dashboard Structure**: Organize panels by system component (Commands, Events, Projections, Infrastructure)
- **Security**: Ensure Prometheus endpoint is properly secured in production

## Testing Guidance

- **Objective**: Verify comprehensive monitoring coverage with accurate metrics and effective alerting
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  - **Metrics Collection Tests**:
    - Test Axon metrics are properly collected and exposed
    - Verify custom EAF metrics are generated correctly
    - Test metric accuracy under various load conditions
    - Validate metric cardinality and performance impact
  - **Dashboard Functionality Tests**:
    - Test all dashboard panels display correct data
    - Verify filtering and time range selection
    - Test dashboard refresh and real-time updates
    - Validate panel drill-down and navigation
  - **Alerting Tests**:
    - Test alert rules trigger correctly under threshold conditions
    - Verify alert notifications are sent to correct channels
    - Test alert resolution when conditions return to normal
    - Validate alert escalation procedures
  - **Performance Impact Tests**:
    - Measure overhead of metrics collection on system performance
    - Test system behavior under high metric cardinality
    - Verify Prometheus scraping doesn't impact application performance
    - Test metric retention and storage requirements
  - **Integration Tests**:
    - Test complete metrics pipeline (app → Prometheus → Grafana)
    - Verify dashboard works with realistic data volumes
    - Test alert manager integration and routing
    - Validate monitoring in different environments
- **Load Testing with Monitoring**:
  ```bash
  # Generate load while monitoring metrics
  artillery run --target http://localhost:8080 load-test-scenario.yml
  # Verify metrics accurately reflect the load patterns
  ```
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - All key system metrics are accurately collected and displayed
  - Dashboard provides actionable insights for operations team
  - Alerts trigger appropriately without false positives
  - Monitoring overhead <5% of system performance
  - Complete visibility into system health and performance
- **Operational Validation**:

  - Dashboard supports troubleshooting workflows
  - Alerts provide sufficient context for response
  - Metrics enable proactive capacity planning
- **Metric Accuracy Testing**:
  - Command counts match application logs

  - NATS metrics align with NATS server statistics
- **Alert Testing Scenarios**:
  - Simulate high event processor lag
  - Generate command processing failures
  - Test NATS connectivity issues
  - Validate database performance alerts
