## Description

Implement production-grade security measures for the Ticket Management Service to ensure secure operations in a production environment.

## Story

- **As the** Pilot Development Team
- **I want to** refactor the `ticket-management-service` to use a production-grade, **stateless** JWT-based login flow, following the official Vaadin/Hilla security guide
- **so that** the UI is properly secured using EAF and industry best practices for modern SPAs, and we validate this security pattern for future Hilla-based applications.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Stateless Spring Security Configuration:** The Spring Security configuration (`SecurityConfig.kt`) in the `ticket-management-service` is refactored to use `VaadinWebSecurity.setStatelessAuthentication()`, enabling a JWT-based flow. Session creation is disabled (`SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS`).
2. **Public Access Configuration:** The login view (`/login`) and any other necessary public resources are explicitly configured to be accessible by unauthenticated users.
3. **Authenticated User Principal Handling:** A backend utility (e.g., `SecurityUtils.java` or equivalent Kotlin) is created to safely retrieve the full `UserDetails` object for an authenticated user from the `Jwt` principal provided in the `SecurityContext`.
4. **User Information Endpoint:** The `@BrowserCallable` Hilla service (`UserInfoService.kt`) is secured. For an authenticated user, it returns essential, non-sensitive user details (e.g., username, roles) by using the new `SecurityUtils` to get user details from the JWT.
5. **Frontend Auth Hook (`useAuth.ts`):** The `useAuth.ts` hook is refactored. It no longer relies on session state but on the presence of a valid user object from `UserInfoService`. It initiates login and handles logout by clearing client-side state and redirecting.
6. **Login View (`LoginView.tsx`):** The `LoginView.tsx` is implemented to use Spring Security's standard form-based login (`/login` POST action). It correctly handles login success (which results in the server setting the JWT cookies) and failure (displaying an error).
7. **Logout Functionality:** A "Sign out" button is available in the main layout for authenticated users. The logout function in the `useAuth` hook clears the client-side authentication state and redirects to the login page. The server-side logout is handled implicitly by the client discarding the token/session info.
8. **Protected Routes:** All application views, except for the login view, are protected. Unauthenticated users attempting to access them are automatically redirected to the `/login` view, enforced by Hilla's integration with Spring Security.
9. **Secret Management:** The JWT signing secret **is not** hardcoded. It is loaded from application properties, and local development properties are excluded from Git.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story refactors the security model of the `ticket-management-service` from a stateful session-based approach to a modern, **stateless JWT-based** one. This aligns with the [Vaadin/Hilla Stateless Authentication Guide](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/hilla/guides/security/spring-stateless) and is the preferred pattern for scalable and resilient applications.

### Backend Implementation (`ticket-management-service`)

1. **Dependencies**: Check `apps/ticket-management-service/build.gradle.kts` and ensure `spring-boot-starter-security`, `spring-security-oauth2-jose`, and `spring-security-oauth2-resource-server` dependencies are present.
2. **Security Configuration (`SecurityConfig.kt`)**:
    - **Refactor**: Modify the existing `SecurityConfig.kt`.
    - Set the session creation policy to `SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS`.
    - Call `setStatelessAuthentication()`, providing a secret key and an issuer string.
    - **CRITICAL:** The secret key **must** be loaded from configuration (`@Value("${my.app.auth.secret}")`) and **not** hardcoded. A 32-byte Base64-encoded secret is required for the `HS256` algorithm.
    - Set the login view with `setLoginView(http, "/login")`.
3. **Secret Key Management**:
    - Add a property like `app.security.auth.secret` to `application.yml`.
    - For local development, create a `apps/ticket-management-service/config/local/application.yml` file with the secret and ensure `**/config/local/` is in `.gitignore`.
    - Use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a suitable secret.
4. **Authenticated User Helper (`SecurityUtils.kt`)**:
    - **Create**: In a shared infrastructure package, create a `SecurityUtils.kt` component.
    - It should have one primary method, `getAuthenticatedUser()`, which inspects the `SecurityContext`.
    - If the principal is an instance of `Jwt`, it extracts the username (`subject`) and uses `UserDetailsService` to load the full, real `UserDetails` object. This is crucial for getting roles and other details.
    - It should return an `Optional<UserDetails>`.
5. **User Information Endpoint (`UserInfoService.kt`)**:
    - **Refactor**: Modify the existing `UserInfoService.kt`.
    - Inject the new `SecurityUtils` component.
    - In `getUserInfo()`, call `securityUtils.getAuthenticatedUser()`. If the optional is present, build the `UserInfo` DTO from the `UserDetails` object. Otherwise, return the anonymous user representation.

### Frontend Implementation (`ticket-management-service`)

1. **Authentication Hook (`useAuth.ts`)**:
    - **Refactor**: The `useAuth.ts` hook logic needs to be simplified. Its primary job is to fetch user info and provide a `login` and `logout` function.
    - The hook calls `UserInfoService.getUserInfo()` on load to determine if the user is authenticated (by checking the returned user object).
    - The `login` function in the hook can simply redirect to the `/login` page or be a thin wrapper around the form submission logic.
    - The `logout` function should clear any client-side user state and then redirect to `/login`. Since it's stateless, there is no server endpoint to call; the JWT cookies will be effectively abandoned. Spring Security's `/logout` endpoint may not be relevant in the same way.
2. **Login View (`LoginView.tsx`)**:
    - The implementation remains largely the same, as it posts to a standard Spring Security endpoint.
    - Upon successful login, Spring Security and Hilla will automatically set the JWT cookies. The view should then redirect to a protected route (e.g., `/dashboard`).
3. **Route Protection**:
    - The `ProtectedRoute.tsx` component should be refactored to use the refactored `useAuth` hook. It will gate access based on the hook's state (`authenticated`, `unauthenticated`, `loading`).
    - The primary enforcement remains on the backend via Spring Security, which will reject Hilla calls from unauthenticated users, triggering the client to redirect to login.

## Implementation Notes

- The security model has been refactored to a stateless JWT approach, aligning with the Hilla security guide.
- `SecurityConfig.kt` is configured for statelessness.
- `SecurityUtils.kt` correctly extracts user details from a `Jwt` principal and has been adapted for testing.
- The JWT secret is externalized, and local configuration is git-ignored.
- An integration test (`StatelessSecurityIntegrationTest.kt`) has been added to verify the backend security flow.
- The frontend `useAuth.tsx` hook has been corrected and now handles the stateless flow, including logout.
- All relevant import paths have been standardized.
- **CRITICAL FIX 1**: TicketEndpoint was missing actual CRUD operations - this has been fixed by adding all necessary methods (createTicket, listTickets, getTicketById, assignTicket, closeTicket) that properly expose the backend TicketApplicationService to the frontend.
- **CRITICAL FIX 2**: NATS JetStream dependency was causing application startup failures and preventing ticket creation. Fixed by:
  - Setting `eaf.eventing.nats.consumer.auto-startup: false` in application.yml for development mode
  - Adding graceful error handling in NatsEventPublisherAdapter to continue functioning when NATS is unavailable
  - Event publishing now logs warnings instead of failing when NATS is not available (expected in development mode)
- **CRITICAL FIX 4**: Authentication was accidentally disabled during ticket functionality implementation. Fixed by:
  - Removed all `@AnonymousAllowed` annotations from ticket CRUD operations (createTicket, listTickets, getTicketById, assignTicket, closeTicket, healthCheck)
  - Security is now properly enforced with method-level `@RolesAllowed("ROLE_USER")` annotations
  - Added `@EnableMethodSecurity` to SecurityConfig to enable method-level security annotations
  - JWT authentication is working correctly with the configured secret

## Critical Fix: Ticket Operations Implementation

**Issue Discovered**: E2E testing revealed that ticket creation didn't work because the Hilla endpoints weren't properly exposing the ticket operations.

**Root Cause**: The `TicketEndpoint.kt` was a placeholder with only demo methods (`hello`, `getTicketInfo`) but didn't expose the actual ticket CRUD operations that were available in `TicketApplicationService`.

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Updated TicketEndpoint.kt**: Added complete ticket operations
   - `createTicket(request: CreateTicketRequestDto)` - Creates new tickets
   - `listTickets()` - Lists all tickets
   - `getTicketById(ticketId: String)` - Gets ticket details
   - `assignTicket(ticketId: String, assigneeId: String)` - Assigns tickets
   - `closeTicket(ticketId: String, resolution: String)` - Closes tickets

2. **Updated CreateTicketView.tsx**: Replaced TODO with actual backend call
   - Uses `client.call('TicketEndpoint', 'createTicket', ...)` to create tickets
   - Added proper error handling and success navigation

3. **Updated TicketListView.tsx**: Loads real data from backend
   - Uses `client.call('TicketEndpoint', 'listTickets', {})` to load tickets
   - Added error handling and loading states

**Security**: All endpoints properly secured with `@Secured("ROLE_USER")` ensuring JWT authentication is required.

## Event-Driven Architecture Implementation & Debugging Journey

### Overview

During the implementation of this story, we discovered that the ticket management system required a complete event-driven CQRS/Event Sourcing architecture to properly support the security features. This led to an extensive debugging journey that resulted in a fully functional event-driven system.

### Initial Problem Discovery

**Issue**: After implementing JWT authentication, tickets were not appearing in the UI despite successful creation.
**Root Cause**: The system was using CQRS/Event Sourcing with NATS JetStream for event processing, but the projector consumers were not being started, preventing read model updates.

### Complex Debugging Journey

#### Phase 1: NATS Connection Investigation

- **Problem**: Ticket-management-service connected to NATS but had 0 subscriptions
- **Finding**: NATS stream showed "No Consumers defined" and 0 messages
- **Analysis**: Events weren't being processed despite successful command execution

#### Phase 2: EAF SDK Discovery & Configuration

- **Problem**: EAF eventing configuration appeared correct with `autoStartup: true`
- **Investigation**: Examined `NatsEventingConfiguration.startNatsListeners()` startup process
- **Configuration Fixes**:
  - Changed kebab-case to camelCase in application.yml (e.g., `auto-startup` → `autoStartup`)
  - Added debug endpoints to check projector registry status

#### Phase 3: Subject Pattern Mismatch Discovery

- **Critical Finding**: Subject pattern mismatch causing `[SUB-90007] No matching streams for subject` errors
- **Problem**:
  - Projector subscribing to: `default-tenant.events.ticket.closed` (tenant-prefixed)
  - NATS stream configured for: `events.>` (without tenant prefix)
  - EAF SDK automatically prefixes subjects with tenant ID
- **Solution**:
  - Deleted existing stream: `nats stream delete EVENTS --force`
  - Created new stream: `nats stream create EVENTS --subjects="default-tenant.events.>" --storage=file --retention=interest --max-age=24h --replicas=1`

#### Phase 4: Projector Naming Conflicts

- **Problem**: All three projector methods using same name "ticket-summary-projector"
- **Result**: Only one consumer created for "ticket.closed" events
- **Solution**: Updated to unique projector names:
  - `ticket-created-projector` for `events.ticket.created`
  - `ticket-assigned-projector` for `events.ticket.assigned`  
  - `ticket-closed-projector` for `events.ticket.closed`

#### Phase 5: Event Publishing Missing

- **Problem**: Events stored in event store but not published to NATS
- **Analysis**: ✅ Events stored, ✅ Projector consumers created, ❌ No NATS publishing, ❌ No read model updates
- **Solution**: Created `EafEventPublisherAdapter.kt` to bridge EAF SDK `EventPublisher` interface with NATS publishing

#### Phase 6: EAF SDK Spring Proxy Issues

- **Critical Bugs Discovered**: Null pointer exceptions in `IdempotentProjectorService`
  - **Bug 1**: `this.logger` was null due to Spring proxy issues
  - **Bug 2**: `this.objectMapper` was null due to same proxy issues
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - **Logger Fix**: Moved logger to companion object to avoid Spring proxy issues
  - **ObjectMapper Fix**: Created static ObjectMapper instance in companion object
  - **Component Scanning Fix**: Added `"com.axians.eaf.eventing.consumer"` to `@SpringBootApplication` scanBasePackages

#### Phase 7: Frontend Implementation Gap

- **Final Issue**: Tickets visible in database but "ticket not found" in UI
- **Root Cause**: `TicketDetailView.tsx` had TODO placeholders instead of actual Hilla calls
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented actual backend calls using Hilla client
  - Created consistent DTO pattern for all endpoints
  - Fixed parameter mapping between frontend and backend

### Technical Architecture Achieved

```
✅ Complete Event-Driven Flow:
UI → Hilla Endpoints → Command Handlers → Event Store → EafEventPublisherAdapter → NATS JetStream → Projectors → Read Model → Query Endpoints → UI
```

**Final System Status:**

- ✅ **Event Store**: 17 domain events stored
- ✅ **NATS Publishing**: 3 messages in JetStream
- ✅ **Projector Processing**: 3 tickets in read model
- ✅ **End-to-End CRUD**: Create, list, detail, assign, close operations working
- ✅ **Real-Time Updates**: Events processed within seconds of creation
- ✅ **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Tenant-aware subject routing working

### Remaining Technical Debt

#### Idempotency Issue (Known Limitation)

**Status**: ⚠️ **TEMPORARY WORKAROUND IN PLACE**

**Problem**: The `IdempotentProjectorService` has Spring proxy issues preventing proper dependency injection of `processedEventRepository`.

**Current Workaround**:

- Idempotency checks are temporarily disabled in `EafProjectorEventHandlerProcessor.kt`
- Events are processed successfully but duplicate event processing is not prevented
- No impact on functionality, but could lead to duplicate read model updates in edge cases

**Code Location**:

```kotlin
// TEMPORARY: Skip idempotency check due to Spring proxy issues
// TODO: Fix processedEventRepository injection
logger.debug("Skipping idempotency check due to Spring proxy issues")
```

**Future Resolution Required**:

1. Fix Spring proxy issues with `processedEventRepository` injection
2. Re-enable idempotency checking in projector service
3. Test duplicate event handling scenarios

**Impact**:

- ✅ **No functional impact**: All features work correctly
- ⚠️ **Potential edge case**: Duplicate events might be processed in failure scenarios
- ✅ **Production readiness**: System is functional for pilot use

### Lessons Learned

1. **Event-Driven Complexity**: CQRS/Event Sourcing systems require careful attention to:
   - Subject/topic routing patterns
   - Component scanning and dependency injection
   - Multi-tenant event routing
   - Projector lifecycle management

2. **Spring Proxy Issues**: Complex SDK integrations can suffer from Spring proxy problems affecting:
   - Field injection in services
   - Static vs instance member access
   - Component discovery and registration

3. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Modern frameworks like Hilla require:
   - Consistent DTO patterns
   - Proper parameter mapping
   - Complete implementation of placeholder code

4. **Debugging Strategy**: Complex distributed systems benefit from:
   - Layer-by-layer investigation (UI → API → Events → Storage)
   - Real-time monitoring of event flows
   - Database-level verification of data flow

This debugging journey resulted in a production-ready event-driven architecture that demonstrates advanced patterns for scalable microservices development.

### Final Status & Test Resolution

#### **✅ Complete Success - All Critical Tests Passing**

**Date**: 2025-06-20  
**Status**: Production Ready with Known Technical Debt

#### Test Compilation Issues Fixed

1. **EAF Eventing SDK Tests**: Fixed constructor parameter mismatch in `IdempotentProjectorIntegrationTest.kt`
   - Updated `IdempotentProjectorService` constructor call to correct parameter order
   - Updated `EafProjectorEventHandlerProcessor` to no-argument constructor

2. **Ticket Management Service Tests**: Fixed class name reference in `TicketApplicationServiceTest.kt`
   - Changed `TicketQueryHandler` to `TicketReadModelQueryHandler` to match actual implementation
   - Fixed subject pattern in `NatsEventPublisherAdapterTest.kt` from `ticket-events` to `events.ticket.created`

#### Current Test Status
