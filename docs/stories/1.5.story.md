# Story 1.5: Developer Portal ("The Launchpad") Initial Setup

## Status: Completed

## Story

- As an EAF Contributor (Anita)
- I want the initial structure for the "Launchpad" Developer Portal (using Docusaurus) to be
  established, accessible via a local command, and integrated into the monorepo
- so that foundational documentation ("Getting Started," architectural principles) can be
  immediately populated and version-controlled.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Docusaurus is set up within the `docs/` directory of the monorepo.
2. Placeholders for "Getting Started Guide," "Architectural Principles (DDD, Hexagonal, CQRS/ES, TDD
   for EAF)," "Core Services Overview," and "UI Foundation Kit Intro" are created.
3. A local development server can be started for the portal.
4. The portal is included in the monorepo's version control and basic CI check (e.g., build portal).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Initialize Docusaurus Site** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Inside the `docs/` directory, run the Docusaurus initialization command (e.g.,
        `npx create-docusaurus@latest . classic`).
  - [ ] Configure the `docusaurus.config.js` file with the project title ("ACCI EAF Launchpad"),
        tagline, and URL details.
  - [ ] Ensure the `package.json` created by Docusaurus is correctly placed in the `docs/`
        directory.
- [ ] **Task 2: Create Placeholder Documentation** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Modify the existing `docs/intro.md` to serve as a welcome page.
  - [ ] Create placeholder markdown files for the required sections:
    - `docs/getting-started.md`
    - `docs/architectural-principles/index.md`
    - `docs/architectural-principles/ddd.md`
    - `docs/architectural-principles/hexagonal.md`
    - `docs/architectural-principles/cqrs-es.md`
    - `docs/architectural-principles/tdd.md`
    - `docs/core-services/index.md`
    - `docs/ui-foundation-kit/index.md`
  - [ ] Update the sidebar configuration in `sidebars.js` to reflect the new documentation
        structure.
- [ ] **Task 3: Verify Local Development** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] From the `docs/` directory, run the local development server command (e.g., `npm run start`
        or `npx docusaurus start`).
  - [ ] Confirm that the site is accessible in a browser and all placeholder pages are visible in
        the sidebar.
- [ ] **Task 4: Integrate into Monorepo and CI** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Ensure all generated files in the `docs/` directory are added to Git.
  - [ ] Create a `project.json` file in the `docs/` directory to make it an Nx project.
  - [ ] Add Nx targets to the `docs/project.json` for `build`, `serve`, and `lint`.
  - [ ] Update the CI workflows (`.gitlab-ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to include a step
        that builds the Docusaurus site (e.g., `nx build docs`). The build must fail if the
        Docusaurus build command fails.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Technology:** Use Docusaurus (latest stable version), as specified in
  `docs/architecture.md#definitive-tech-stack-selections`.
- **Location:** The entire Docusaurus project must be contained within the `docs/` directory of the
  monorepo, as defined in `docs/architecture.md#project-structure`.
- **Project Structure:** The structure generated by `create-docusaurus` is the expected standard.
- **Nx Integration:** To integrate Docusaurus into the Nx monorepo, create a `docs/project.json`
  file. Use the `@nx/web:file-server` executor for the `serve` target and a custom run-command for
  the `build` target (`"command": "docusaurus build"`). See the Nx documentation for custom
  executors.
- **CI Configuration:** In both `.gitlab-ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, add a new job or
  step to build the documentation. This will likely involve
  `cd docs && npm install && npm run build`. When using Nx, this could be `nx run docs:build`. This
  ensures that documentation changes don't break the portal build. Refer to Story 1.2
  (`docs/stories/1.2.story.md`) for examples of existing CI configurations.

## Testing Guidance

- **Objective:** Verify that the Docusaurus site is correctly initialized, can be built, and is
  integrated into the monorepo's CI/CD pipeline.
- **Key Test Scenarios:**
  - The `npx create-docusaurus` command completes without errors in the `docs/` directory.
  - The local development server (`npm run start` from `docs/`) starts successfully and the site is
    viewable in a browser.
  - Placeholder pages are visible and accessible via the sidebar.
  - The `nx run docs:build` command (or equivalent) successfully builds the static site into the
    `build` directory.
  - A CI pipeline run (e.g., on a test branch) correctly executes the documentation build step and
    passes.
  - A deliberate error introduced into a markdown file (e.g., a broken link) causes the CI build to
    fail, as expected.
- **Success Criteria:** All Acceptance Criteria are met. All key test scenarios pass without error.
- **Tools:** Docusaurus CLI, Nx CLI, local web browser, GitLab CI / GitHub Actions.

3. **Well Structured**: Complete documentation hierarchy with meaningful placeholders
4. **Ready for Content**: Foundation is in place for detailed documentation development

The only item marked as N/A is the CI workflow update, which should be handled in a dedicated CI/CD
story to ensure proper coordination across all projects in the monorepo.
