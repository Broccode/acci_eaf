# Story 4.3.2: Implement User Command and Event Handlers

## Status: To Do

## Story
- **As a** Developer
- **I want** to implement the command handlers (`@CommandHandler`) and event sourcing handlers (`@EventSourcingHandler`) for all business operations related to the `User` aggregate
- **so that** the aggregate can process commands and rebuild its state from its event stream.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The `User` aggregate has a constructor that acts as a command handler for a `CreateUserCommand`. It applies a `UserCreatedEvent`.
2. The `User` aggregate has an event sourcing handler for `UserCreatedEvent` that initializes its state.
3. Command handlers are implemented for other user operations (e.g., `ActivateUser`, `ChangeUserRole`). These handlers validate business rules and apply corresponding domain events.
4. Event sourcing handlers are implemented for each new event to correctly update the aggregate's state.
5. All handlers are free of infrastructure code and focus purely on domain logic.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Design Command and Event Structures** (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Create `CreateUserCommand` with required user data (email, username, initial role)
  - [ ] Design `UserCreatedEvent` with complete user state data
  - [ ] Create additional commands (`ActivateUserCommand`, `ChangeUserRoleCommand`, `DeactivateUserCommand`)
  - [ ] Design corresponding events (`UserActivatedEvent`, `UserRoleChangedEvent`, `UserDeactivatedEvent`)
  - [ ] Ensure all commands and events are immutable data classes

- [ ] **Task 2: Implement User Creation Command Handler** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create constructor command handler for `CreateUserCommand`
  - [ ] Implement business validation (unique email, valid role, etc.)
  - [ ] Apply `UserCreatedEvent` with validated user data
  - [ ] Add domain-specific exception handling
  - [ ] Ensure command handler doesn't call external services directly

- [ ] **Task 3: Implement State-Changing Command Handlers** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Implement `@CommandHandler` for `ActivateUserCommand`
  - [ ] Create `@CommandHandler` for `ChangeUserRoleCommand` with role validation
  - [ ] Add `@CommandHandler` for `DeactivateUserCommand` with business rule checks
  - [ ] Implement `@CommandHandler` for `UpdateUserProfileCommand`
  - [ ] Add any additional user-related command handlers

- [ ] **Task 4: Implement Event Sourcing Handlers** (AC: 2, 4)
  - [ ] Create `@EventSourcingHandler` for `UserCreatedEvent` to initialize aggregate state
  - [ ] Implement `@EventSourcingHandler` for `UserActivatedEvent` to update status
  - [ ] Add `@EventSourcingHandler` for `UserRoleChangedEvent` to update roles
  - [ ] Create `@EventSourcingHandler` for `UserDeactivatedEvent` to update status
  - [ ] Ensure all event handlers properly update aggregate state

- [ ] **Task 5: Business Rule Implementation** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Implement user email uniqueness validation within aggregate boundary
  - [ ] Add role transition validation (e.g., can't change from ADMIN to USER if last admin)
  - [ ] Implement user status transition rules
  - [ ] Add password complexity validation if applicable
  - [ ] Create domain-specific business exception types

- [ ] **Task 6: Command Validation and Guards**
  - [ ] Add command precondition validation in command handlers
  - [ ] Implement aggregate state validation before applying events
  - [ ] Add null safety and data validation
  - [ ] Create guard clauses for invalid state transitions
  - [ ] Implement idempotency for commands where appropriate

- [ ] **Task 7: Event Application and State Management**
  - [ ] Ensure events are applied using `AggregateLifecycle.apply()`
  - [ ] Implement proper state update patterns in event handlers
  - [ ] Add event ordering validation if multiple events affect same field
  - [ ] Ensure event handlers maintain aggregate invariants
  - [ ] Add proper error handling for event application failures

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Module Location**: Enhance existing `User` aggregate in `apps/acci-eaf-control-plane/src/main/kotlin/com/axians/eaf/controlplane/domain/model/`
- **Dependencies Required**: Add to build.gradle.kts:
  ```kotlin
  implementation(libs.axon.modelling)
  implementation(libs.axon.eventsourcing)
  implementation(libs.axon.messaging)
  ```
- **Command Handler Pattern**: Use constructor for creation, methods for modifications:
  ```kotlin
  class User {
      @CommandHandler
      constructor(command: CreateUserCommand) {
          // Validation logic
          AggregateLifecycle.apply(UserCreatedEvent(...))
      }
      
      @CommandHandler
      fun handle(command: ActivateUserCommand) {
          // Business rule validation
          AggregateLifecycle.apply(UserActivatedEvent(...))
      }
  }
  ```
- **Event Sourcing Handler Pattern**: Update state without side effects:
  ```kotlin
  @EventSourcingHandler
  fun on(event: UserCreatedEvent) {
      this.id = event.userId
      this.email = event.email
      this.status = UserStatus.PENDING
  }
  ```
- **Command Design**: Commands should be intention-revealing and contain all necessary data:
  ```kotlin
  data class CreateUserCommand(
      val userId: UUID,
      val email: String,
      val username: String,
      val initialRole: UserRole,
      val tenantId: String
  )
  ```
- **Event Design**: Events should capture what happened with complete state data:
  ```kotlin
  data class UserCreatedEvent(
      val userId: UUID,
      val email: String,
      val username: String,
      val role: UserRole,
      val status: UserStatus,
      val createdAt: Instant
  )
  ```
- **Business Rule Enforcement**: Validate in command handlers, not event handlers
- **Error Handling**: Use domain exceptions for business rule violations

## Testing Guidance

- **Objective**: Verify command processing and event sourcing behavior maintain business logic integrity
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  - **Command Handler Tests**:
    - Test successful command processing and event generation
    - Verify business rule validation in command handlers
    - Test command handler exception throwing for invalid commands
    - Validate command idempotency where applicable
  - **Event Sourcing Handler Tests**:
    - Test aggregate state reconstruction from event stream
    - Verify event handlers properly update aggregate state
    - Test event ordering and state consistency
    - Validate aggregate invariants after event application
  - **Business Rule Tests**:
    - Test user creation with valid and invalid data
    - Verify role transition rules and restrictions
    - Test user status transition validation
    - Validate business exception throwing and messages
  - **Integration Tests with Axon Framework**:
    - Test command dispatching through command gateway
    - Verify event store persistence and retrieval
    - Test aggregate loading from event stream
    - Validate correlation data propagation to events
  - **Edge Case Tests**:
    - Test concurrent command processing
    - Verify handling of duplicate commands
    - Test aggregate behavior with missing events
    - Validate recovery from event application failures
- **Given-When-Then Test Structure**: Use Axon test fixtures for behavior verification:
  ```kotlin
  @Test
  fun `should activate user when command is valid`() {
      fixture.given(UserCreatedEvent(...))
          .when(ActivateUserCommand(...))
          .expectEvents(UserActivatedEvent(...))
  }
  ```
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - All command handlers produce correct events
  - Event sourcing handlers properly reconstruct aggregate state
  - Business rules consistently enforced across all operations
  - Aggregate maintains invariants after all state changes
  - Complete test coverage for all command and event scenarios
- **Business Logic Verification**:
  - User lifecycle operations work correctly
  - Role management follows business rules
  - Email uniqueness enforced within aggregate boundary
  - Status transitions follow defined business rules
- **Event Sourcing Verification**:
  - Aggregate can be fully reconstructed from events
  - Event order doesn't break aggregate consistency
  - All state changes captured in events
  - Event handlers are deterministic and side-effect free
- **Tools**: JUnit 5, Axon Test Framework (`AggregateTestFixture`), AssertJ, MockK for external dependencies
