# Story 2.6.2: Generate Core CQRS/ES Components within a Service via CLI

## Status: Review

## Story

- **As a** Backend Developer (Majlinda)
- **I want** to use the ACCI EAF CLI to generate boilerplate code for common CQRS/ES components (specifically Aggregates, Commands, Domain Events, and basic Projector stubs) within an existing EAF Kotlin/Spring service, pre-wired with EAF SDK patterns and annotations
- **so that** I can rapidly extend my domain model with consistent, EAF-compliant code.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. CLI command `eaf generate aggregate <AggregateName> --service=<service-name>` creates:
    - A Kotlin data class for a creation Command (e.g., `Create<AggregateName>Command.kt` in an `application/port/in` or `domain/command` package).
    - A Kotlin data class for a creation Event (e.g., `<AggregateName>CreatedEvent.kt` in a `domain/event` package).
    - A Kotlin class for the Aggregate root (e.g., `<AggregateName>.kt` in `domain/model`) annotated with `@EafAggregate` (or equivalent), including an `@AggregateIdentifier` field, a constructor annotated as a command handler for the creation command which applies the creation event, and an event sourcing handler method for the creation event.
    - A basic unit test stub (e.g., `<AggregateName>Test.kt`) for the Aggregate using EAF's TDD setup.
2. CLI command `eaf generate command <CommandName> --aggregate=<AggregateName>` adds a new Kotlin data class for the command and a placeholder command handler method (annotated appropriately) within the specified Aggregate class.
3. CLI command `eaf generate event <EventName> --aggregate=<AggregateName>` adds a new Kotlin data class for the event and a placeholder event sourcing handler method within the specified Aggregate class.
4. CLI command `eaf generate projector <ProjectorName> --service=<service-name> --event=<EventName>` creates a Kotlin class stub (e.g., `<ProjectorName>.kt` in `infrastructure/adapter/in/messaging` or `application/projection`) for a Projector, including an event handler method (e.g., using `@NatsJetStreamListener` or equivalent EAF SDK annotation) for the specified event type.
5. Generated components are placed in appropriate packages according to the service's Hexagonal Architecture and DDD conventions.
6. All generated Kotlin code adheres to EAF coding standards and passes Spotless formatting.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Extend CLI with `generate` subcommands** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] In `tools/acci-eaf-cli`, modify the main `generate` command to accept new subcommands: `aggregate`, `command`, `event`, and `projector`.
  - [x] Create a new `picocli` command class for each generator (e.g., `GenerateAggregateCommand.kt`, `GenerateCommandCommand.kt`, etc.).
- [x] **Task 2: Implement `generate aggregate` command** (AC: 1, 5, 6)
  - [x] Implement logic to locate the specified service path (e.g., `apps/<service-name>`).
  - [x] Generate the creation Command data class file.
  - [x] Generate the creation Event data class file.
  - [x] Generate the Aggregate root class file, including `@EafAggregate`, `@AggregateIdentifier`, command handler constructor, and event sourcing handler.
  - [x] Generate the TDD-style test file for the Aggregate with a basic test setup.
  - [x] Ensure all files are placed in the correct hexagonal architecture packages (`domain/model`, `domain/event`, etc.).
- [x] **Task 3: Implement `generate command` command** (AC: 2, 5, 6)
  - [x] Implement logic to locate the target Aggregate file within the specified service.
  - [x] Generate the new Command data class file in the appropriate package.
  - [x] **Modify** the existing Aggregate class file to add a new annotated command handler method stub.
- [x] **Task 4: Implement `generate event` command** (AC: 3, 5, 6)
  - [x] Implement logic to locate the target Aggregate file within the specified service.
  - [x] Generate the new Event data class file in the `domain/event` package.
  - [x] **Modify** the existing Aggregate class file to add a new annotated event sourcing handler method stub.
- [x] **Task 5: Implement `generate projector` command** (AC: 4, 5, 6)
  - [x] Implement logic to locate the specified service path.
  - [x] Generate the Projector class file in the `infrastructure/adapter/input/messaging` package.
  - [x] The generated class should include a placeholder event handler method annotated with `@NatsJetStreamListener` (or equivalent from `eaf-eventing-sdk`) for the specified event.
- [x] **Task 6: Code Quality & Documentation** (AC: 6)
  - [x] Implement a templating or file-writing mechanism that ensures all generated code is formatted correctly via Spotless.
  - [x] Add unit tests for the new generator commands within the CLI project.
  - [x] Update CLI help documentation and The Launchpad documentation for the new commands.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story extends the ACCI EAF CLI (`tools/acci-eaf-cli`) to accelerate development within existing EAF services. The generators must read and modify existing source files.

- **Hexagonal & Package Conventions**: The generators MUST adhere strictly to the package conventions defined in `docs/architecture.md`. The target service (created by Story 2.6.1) will already have this structure.
  - Commands: `.../application/port/in` or `.../domain/command`
  - Events: `.../domain/event`
  - Aggregates: `.../domain/model`
  - Projectors: `.../infrastructure/adapter/in/messaging` or `.../application/projection`
- **EAF SDK Annotations**: The generated code must use the custom annotations provided by the EAF SDKs, as outlined in the PRD (Story 2.4.1) and Architecture documents. Key annotations to use are:
  - `@EafAggregate` (for the aggregate root class)
  - `@AggregateIdentifier` (from Axon, or an EAF equivalent, on the ID field)
  - `@EafCommandHandler` (or equivalent for methods/constructors that handle commands)
  - `@EafEventSourcingHandler` (for methods that apply state from events)
  - `@NatsJetStreamListener` (for projector event handlers, from `eaf-eventing-sdk`)
- **Code Modification**: The `generate command` and `generate event` subtasks require modifying an existing Kotlin source file. This is a critical operation. The implementation should robustly parse the Kotlin file to find the correct class definition and insert the new method stubs without corrupting the file. Libraries like `KotlinPoet` or a robust parsing strategy should be considered over simple text replacement.
- **TDD Focus**: The generated Aggregate test stub should follow the TDD-first pattern, similar to the output of the `generate service` command. It should provide a clear starting point for writing tests against the Aggregate's command handlers.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude Sonnet 4`

### Completion Notes List

Starting implementation:

- Reviewed existing CLI structure and patterns
- Analyzed EAF SDK annotations from documentation
- Confirmed package structure conventions for hexagonal architecture
- Will implement tasks sequentially as defined in the story

Implementation Progress:

- ✅ Created all 4 new CLI command classes (GenerateAggregateCommand, GenerateCommandCommand, GenerateEventCommand, GenerateProjectorCommand)
- ✅ Updated main GenerateCommand to include new subcommands
- ✅ Implemented AggregateGenerator with full CQRS/ES component generation (Command, Event, Aggregate, Test)
- ✅ Implemented CommandGenerator that generates command files and modifies existing aggregates
- ✅ Implemented EventGenerator that generates event files and modifies existing aggregates  
- ✅ Implemented ProjectorGenerator with NATS JetStream listener support
- ✅ Extended TemplateEngine with all required CQRS/ES templates using proper EAF SDK annotations
- ✅ Added comprehensive unit tests for all generators (AggregateGeneratorTest, CommandGeneratorTest, EventGeneratorTest, ProjectorGeneratorTest)
- ✅ All generators follow hexagonal architecture package conventions
- ✅ Generated code uses proper EAF SDK annotations (@EafAggregate, @EafCommandHandler, @EafEventSourcingHandler, @NatsJetStreamListener)
- ✅ Code compiles successfully and passes Spotless formatting

✅ **All Tests Passing**: Fixed all test failures by resolving ProjectorGeneratorTest setup issues (missing service directories) and ServiceGeneratorTest naming conflicts (double "Service" in class names). All 27 tests now pass successfully following the broken window theory principle.

✅ **Documentation Complete**: Updated The Launchpad documentation (`docs/docusaurus-docs/developer-tools/acci-eaf-cli.md`) with comprehensive coverage of all new CQRS/ES generation commands including usage examples, generated code samples, and EAF SDK integration details.
