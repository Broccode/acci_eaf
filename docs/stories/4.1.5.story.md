# Story 4.1.5: Analyze & Script Database Schema Changes

## Status: To Do

## Story

- **As a** Developer
- **I want** to analyze the existing `domain_events` table for Axon compatibility and create a Flyway/Liquibase migration script
- **so that** the database schema supports Axon's event sourcing requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The existing `domain_events` table in `V1__create_eventstore_tables.sql` is analyzed.
2. A new Flyway migration script is created to add any missing columns required by Axon (e.g., a dedicated column for the aggregate identifier if `stream_id` is not sufficient).
3. The script creates any additional indexes needed for optimal query performance by the `EafPostgresEventStorageEngine` (e.g., a composite index on `(tenant_id, global_sequence_id)`).
4. The migration script is tested and verified to run successfully against a test database.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Analyze Current Event Store Schema** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Review `libs/eaf-eventsourcing-sdk/src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__create_eventstore_tables.sql`
  - [ ] Document current `domain_events` table structure and column purposes
  - [ ] Compare against Axon Framework's expected event store schema requirements
  - [ ] Identify gaps in metadata storage (aggregate type, aggregate identifier clarity)
  - [ ] Analyze existing indexes and query patterns for Axon compatibility

- [ ] **Task 2: Design Schema Enhancements for Axon** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Define additional columns needed for Axon integration:
    - `aggregate_type` VARCHAR(255) for better aggregate identification
    - `sequence_number` BIGINT for aggregate-specific event ordering
    - `payload_type` VARCHAR(255) for event type identification
    - `payload_revision` VARCHAR(10) for event schema versioning
  - [ ] Plan data migration strategy for existing events
  - [ ] Design backward compatibility approach for existing EAF SDK usage
  - [ ] Document column mapping between EAF EventStore and Axon requirements

- [ ] **Task 3: Create Performance Optimization Indexes** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Design composite index `idx_events_tenant_sequence` on `(tenant_id, global_sequence_id)`
  - [ ] Create aggregate-specific index `idx_events_aggregate` on `(tenant_id, stream_id, sequence_number)`
  - [ ] Add tracking processor index `idx_events_tracking` on `(tenant_id, global_sequence_id, created_at)`
  - [ ] Create payload type index `idx_events_payload_type` on `(tenant_id, payload_type)`
  - [ ] Analyze and optimize existing indexes for multi-tenant Axon queries

- [ ] **Task 4: Create Flyway Migration Script** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create `V3__enhance_eventstore_for_axon.sql` in migration directory
  - [ ] Add new columns with appropriate NOT NULL constraints and default values
  - [ ] Create all performance indexes with proper naming conventions
  - [ ] Add comments to explain Axon-specific enhancements
  - [ ] Include data migration scripts for existing events (set defaults for new columns)

- [ ] **Task 5: Backward Compatibility Verification**
  - [ ] Ensure existing EAF EventStore SDK continues to work unchanged
  - [ ] Test that current event storage and retrieval patterns are unaffected
  - [ ] Verify existing applications can upgrade without code changes
  - [ ] Create compatibility tests for mixed Axon/EAF SDK usage scenarios

- [ ] **Task 6: Migration Testing and Validation** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Test migration script against development databases with sample data
  - [ ] Verify migration rollback scenarios and data integrity
  - [ ] Test schema changes against large datasets (1M+ events)
  - [ ] Validate index creation performance and effectiveness
  - [ ] Create automated tests for migration success verification

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Migration Location**: `libs/eaf-eventsourcing-sdk/src/main/resources/db/migration/V3__enhance_eventstore_for_axon.sql`
- **Schema Analysis**: Review current EAF EventStore schema design in existing migration files
- **Axon Requirements**: Study Axon Framework documentation for event store schema expectations
- **Index Strategy**: Focus on indexes that support:
  - High-performance event streaming by global sequence
  - Fast aggregate event loading by stream_id + sequence
  - Efficient tenant isolation in all queries
  - TrackingEventProcessor resume scenarios
- **Column Design Principles**:
  - All new columns should be nullable initially for backward compatibility
  - Use consistent VARCHAR sizes matching Axon conventions
  - Ensure proper database-specific data types (PostgreSQL focus)
- **Performance Considerations**: 
  - Indexes should not significantly impact write performance
  - Consider partial indexes for tenant-specific optimizations
  - Plan for millions of events in production scenarios
- **Migration Safety**: 
  - All migrations must be reversible
  - Test with realistic data volumes
  - Minimize downtime during deployment

## Testing Guidance

- **Objective**: Ensure schema enhancements support Axon requirements while maintaining EAF EventStore SDK compatibility
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  - **Schema Migration Tests**:
    - Fresh database migration from V1 to V3 works correctly
    - Existing database upgrade from V2 to V3 preserves all data
    - Migration rollback scenarios restore original schema
    - Large dataset migration performance (1M+ events)
  - **Functionality Tests**:
    - Existing EAF EventStore SDK operations continue working
    - New Axon-specific columns are populated correctly
    - All indexes are created and used by query optimizer
    - Multi-tenant data isolation maintained after migration
  - **Performance Tests**:
    - Query performance improvement with new indexes
    - Write performance impact measurement
    - Concurrent access during migration (if applicable)
    - Index effectiveness verification with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
  - **Compatibility Tests**:
    - Mixed usage of EAF SDK and Axon Framework on same schema
    - Backward compatibility with existing applications
    - Forward compatibility for future Axon features
- **Migration Validation Criteria**:
  - Zero data loss during migration
  - All existing queries perform at least as well as before
  - New Axon queries perform within established SLAs
  - Schema changes are backward compatible
- **Test Data Strategy**:
  - Use realistic multi-tenant event datasets
  - Include edge cases (very old events, large payloads, etc.)
  - Test with data patterns matching production scenarios
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - Migration completes successfully on datasets of 10M+ events
  - Query performance meets Axon Framework requirements
  - 100% backward compatibility maintained
  - All new indexes are utilized effectively by query planner
- **Tools**: PostgreSQL 15+, Flyway migration testing, pgbench for performance testing, EXPLAIN ANALYZE for query optimization
