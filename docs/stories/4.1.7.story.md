# Story 4.1.7: Create Axon Framework Training Materials

## Status: To Do

## Story

- **As a** Tech Lead
- **I want** to create a training presentation and code examples covering Axon v5 core concepts (Aggregates, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Configuration)
- **so that** I can onboard the development team effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new presentation (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Markdown) is created that explains the core concepts of Axon Framework.
2. The training materials specifically cover how Axon will be integrated into the EAF architecture, referencing our custom `EventStorageEngine`.
3. The materials include practical code examples for defining Aggregates, Commands, and Events using our established patterns.
4. A hands-on lab or exercise is designed to guide developers through building a simple event-sourced component with Axon and the EAF SDKs.
5. The training materials are added to "The Launchpad" developer portal.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Documentation Location**: `docs/docusaurus-docs/core-services/axon-framework/`
- **Presentation Format**: Use Markdown with Mermaid diagrams for version-controlled, maintainable content
- **Code Examples**:
  - Use realistic EAF domain examples (not generic "Bank Account" examples)
  - Follow established EAF coding standards and patterns
  - Include proper package structure and import statements
  - Show integration with existing EAF SDKs
- **Learning Progression**: Structure from basic concepts to advanced patterns:
  1. Event Sourcing fundamentals
  2. Basic Aggregate and Command patterns  
  3. Event Handlers and Projections
  4. EAF-specific integrations
  5. Advanced patterns (Sagas, Upcasting)
  6. Testing and operational concerns
- **Interactive Elements**: Include decision flowcharts, troubleshooting guides, and practical exercises
- **Integration Points**: Reference existing EAF documentation and show how Axon fits into overall architecture
- **Code Sample Strategy**:
  - Provide complete, runnable examples
  - Include both success and error scenarios
  - Show proper logging and monitoring integration
  - Demonstrate testing approaches
