# Story 4.1.7: Create Axon Framework Training Materials

## Status: Completed

## Story

- **As a** Tech Lead
- **I want** to create a training presentation and code examples covering Axon v5 core concepts (Aggregates, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Configuration)
- **so that** I can onboard the development team effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new presentation (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Markdown) is created that explains the core concepts of Axon Framework.
2. The training materials specifically cover how Axon will be integrated into the EAF architecture, referencing our custom `EventStorageEngine`.
3. The materials include practical code examples for defining Aggregates, Commands, and Events using our established patterns.
4. A hands-on lab or exercise is designed to guide developers through building a simple event-sourced component with Axon and the EAF SDKs.
5. The training materials are added to "The Launchpad" developer portal.
