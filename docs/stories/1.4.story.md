# Story 1.4: TDD Setup & Examples

## Status: Completed

## Story

- As a Developer (Lirika)
- I want a functional Test-Driven Design (TDD) setup readily available for both Kotlin/Spring (JUnit 5, MockK) and the Vaadin/Hilla/React UI framework, complete with integrated testing libraries and illustrative example tests for a simple component/service
- so that I can easily practice and strictly adhere to TDD.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1:** An example Kotlin/Spring service within an EAF module (e.g., a new simple service in `libs/eaf-sdk/eaf-core`) includes a unit test (using JUnit 5 & MockK) written _before_ its minimal implementation, demonstrating the TDD red-green-refactor cycle.
2. **AC2:** An example React component (within `libs/ui-foundation-kit`) includes a unit test (using Vitest + React Testing Library) demonstrating TDD for a UI component. The test should be written before the component's implementation.
3. **AC3:** All necessary testing libraries are correctly configured in `build.gradle.kts` files (for backend, ensuring JUnit 5 and MockK are available for all services) and the relevant `package.json` file (for `ui-foundation-kit`, ensuring Vitest and React Testing Library are included).
4. **AC4:** The "Launchpad" Developer Portal (`docs/operational-guidelines.md` or a new file) includes a concise guide on the TDD workflow expected for ACCI EAF development, referencing these new examples.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Configure Backend TDD Dependencies** (AC: 3)
  - [x] Verify `junit-jupiter` and `mockk` are defined in `libs.versions.toml`.
  - [x] Ensure `testImplementation(libs.junit.jupiter)` and `testImplementation(libs.mockk)` are included in the root `build.gradle.kts` `subprojects` block or another common configuration applied to all service modules.
- [x] **Task 2: Create Backend TDD Example** (AC: 1)
  - [x] In `libs/eaf-sdk/eaf-core`, create a new package for a simple example (e.g., `com.axians.eaf.core.example.calculator`).
  - [x] **Test First:** Create `CalculatorServiceTest.kt`. Write a test case for an `add(a, b)` method (e.g., `fun`should return sum of two numbers`()`). Use MockK if any dependency needs mocking for demonstration, otherwise a simple unit test is fine. Ensure this test fails as the implementation does not exist.
  - [x] **Implement:** Create the `CalculatorService.kt` with the `add(a, b)` method just sufficient to make the test pass.
  - [x] **Refactor:** Review the simple implementation and test for any necessary refactoring.
- [x] **Task 3: Configure Frontend TDD Dependencies** (AC: 3)
  - [x] In `libs/ui-foundation-kit/package.json`, add the necessary `devDependencies` for testing: `vitest`, `@vitest/ui`, `jsdom`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`.
  - [x] Add a `test` script to `package.json` (e.g., `"test": "vitest"`).
  - [x] Create a `vite.config.ts` (or `vitest.config.ts`) file to configure the test environment (e.g., `globals: true`, `environment: 'jsdom'`).
- [x] **Task 4: Create Frontend TDD Example** (AC: 2)
  - [x] In `libs/ui-foundation-kit/src/components/`, create a new directory `SimpleCounter`.
  - [x] **Test First:** Create `SimpleCounter.test.tsx`. Write a test that renders a counter component, simulates a button click, and asserts that the displayed count increments. The test should fail initially.
  - [x] **Implement:** Create the `SimpleCounter.tsx` component with a button and a display element. Implement the state and logic required to make the test pass.
  - [x] **Refactor:** Review the component and test for clarity and correctness.
- [x] **Task 5: Document TDD Workflow in Launchpad** (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create a new section in `docs/operational-guidelines.md` or a new dedicated file (e.g., `docs/tdd-guide.md`) for the TDD workflow.
  - [x] Explain the red-green-refactor cycle as it applies to EAF.
  - [x] Link directly to the newly created `CalculatorServiceTest.kt` and `SimpleCounter.test.tsx` files as official examples.
  - [x] Provide command-line instructions for running backend (`nx run-many -t test`) and frontend (`npm test`) tests.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Backend Testing:**
  - **Tools:** JUnit 5, MockK.
  - **Reference:** The "Overall Testing Strategy" in `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/operational-guidelines.md`.
  - **Naming:** Test functions should use backticks for descriptive names, e.g., ``fun `should do something under specific conditions`()``.
  - **Location:** Test files must be in the same package as the source file, within the `src/test/kotlin` directory.
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - **Tools:** Vitest is preferred for its speed and Vite integration. Use React Testing Library for rendering components and interacting with them.
  - **Reference:** Consult Vitest documentation ([https://vitest.dev/](https://vitest.dev/)) and React Testing Library docs ([https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)).
  - **Configuration:** The test environment needs to be configured to use `jsdom` to simulate a browser environment for React component rendering.
- **Project Structure Alignment:**
  - The backend example should be placed in a non-intrusive way, ideally within `eaf-core` as it's a foundational pattern demonstration.
  - The frontend component should be added to the `ui-foundation-kit` following the existing component structure.
