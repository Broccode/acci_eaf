# Story 3.1.4: Migrate Integration Tests to SpringMockK Annotations

## Status: Completed

## Story

- **As a** Backend Developer
- **I need** to migrate our Spring Boot integration tests from manual MockK setup to SpringMockK's `@MockkBean` and `@SpykBean` annotations
- **so that** I can have cleaner, more maintainable integration tests that properly integrate mocked beans into the Spring application context.

## Problem Statement

Currently, our integration tests are mixing manual MockK mock creation with Spring Boot's test framework, which creates several issues:

1. **Inconsistent Mock Integration**: Manual mocks aren't properly integrated into the Spring application context, leading to potential wiring issues
2. **Verbose Test Setup**: Tests require manual mock creation and context configuration instead of leveraging Spring's declarative approach
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Each test class needs custom mock setup rather than using Spring Boot's standardized mocking annotations
4. **Pattern Inconsistency**: We already have SpringMockK in our dependencies but aren't leveraging its core functionality

**Current Pattern** (problematic):

```kotlin
@SpringBootTest(classes = [TestIamServiceApplication::class])
class UserManagementIntegrationTest {
    // Manual mock creation doesn't integrate well with Spring context
    private val externalService = mockk<SomeExternalService>()
    
    @Autowired
    private lateinit var userService: UserService
}
```

**Target Pattern** (SpringMockK):

```kotlin
@SpringBootTest(classes = [TestIamServiceApplication::class])
class UserManagementIntegrationTest {
    @MockkBean
    private lateinit var externalService: SomeExternalService
    
    @Autowired
    private lateinit var userService: UserService
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Identify Integration Tests**: Audit all existing integration tests to identify those that would benefit from SpringMockK annotations
2. **Migrate @MockkBean Usage**: Replace manual MockK mock creation with `@MockkBean` for external dependencies in integration tests
3. **Implement @SpykBean Where Needed**: Use `@SpykBean` for partial mocking of Spring beans when appropriate
4. **Update Test Documentation**: Update integration test patterns in developer documentation to show SpringMockK best practices
5. **Maintain Test Coverage**: Ensure all migrated tests maintain their original functionality and coverage
6. **CI Pipeline Validation**: All tests pass in CI after migration
7. **Create Migration Guidelines**: Document the decision criteria for when to use SpringMockK vs regular MockK

## Dev Technical Guidance

### SpringMockK Benefits

1. **Proper Spring Integration**: Mocked beans become part of the Spring application context
2. **Automatic Bean Replacement**: Spring automatically replaces real beans with mocks
3. **Cleaner Test Code**: No manual wiring of mocks into the context
4. **Consistent with Spring Boot Patterns**: Follows the same pattern as `@MockBean` but for MockK

### Migration Strategy

#### Use SpringMockK When

- Writing Spring Boot integration tests (`@SpringBootTest`, `@WebMvcTest`, etc.)
- You need mocked beans to be part of the Spring context
- Testing controllers, services, or other Spring-managed components
- You want to test the full Spring wiring with some dependencies mocked

#### Keep Regular MockK When

- Writing pure unit tests
- Testing classes in isolation
- You don't need Spring context
- Faster test execution is important

### Implementation Pattern

```kotlin
@SpringBootTest(classes = [TestIamServiceApplication::class])
@Testcontainers
@ActiveProfiles("test")
@Transactional
@Import(IamServiceTestcontainerConfiguration::class, JpaConfig::class)
class UserManagementIntegrationTest {
    
    @MockkBean
    private lateinit var externalUserValidator: ExternalUserValidator
    
    @SpykBean
    private lateinit var emailService: EmailService  // When you need partial mocking
    
    @Autowired
    private lateinit var userService: UserService
    
    @Test
    fun `should integrate properly with mocked external dependency`() {
        // Given
        every { externalUserValidator.validate(any()) } returns ValidationResult.success()
        every { emailService.sendWelcomeEmail(any()) } just Runs
        
        // When
        val result = userService.createUser(validUserRequest)
        
        // Then
        assertThat(result).isNotNull()
        verify { externalUserValidator.validate(any()) }
        verify { emailService.sendWelcomeEmail(any()) }
    }
}
```

### Configuration Requirements

Ensure your test configuration supports SpringMockK:

```kotlin
// In TestApplication classes
@SpringBootApplication(
    scanBasePackages = [
        "com.axians.eaf.iam.application",
        "com.axians.eaf.iam.domain", 
        "com.axians.eaf.iam.infrastructure",
        "com.axians.eaf.iam.web"
    ]
)
class TestIamApplication  // Allows SpringMockK to work properly
```

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Update `SystemInitializationIntegrationTest` to use SpringMockK annotations (No mocking needed - proper design)
  - [x] Migrate other IAM integration tests as identified (Already using SpringMockK where appropriate)

- [x] **Task 3: Migrate Control Plane Integration Tests** (AC: 2, 5)
  - [x] Update any existing Control Plane integration tests (All use real components appropriately)

  - [x] Verify CI pipeline passes with all changes (Integration tests using SpringMockK pass)
  - [x] Check test coverage reports maintain coverage levels (No migration needed - coverage maintained)

## Implementation Notes

### Affected Services

- **IAM Service**: Multiple integration tests that can benefit from SpringMockK
- **Control Plane Service**: Future integration tests should use SpringMockK patterns
- **Any future services**: Will follow the new SpringMockK patterns

### Testing Strategy

- Run full test suite before and after migration to ensure no regression
- Validate that mocked beans are properly injected in Spring context
- Check that all MockK verification patterns still work correctly

### Risk Mitigation

- Migrate one test class at a time to minimize blast radius
- Keep backup of original test patterns until migration is validated
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage throughout migration

## Dependencies

- **Internal**: Existing SpringMockK dependency in `libs.versions.toml`
- **External**: None - SpringMockK is already available

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used
