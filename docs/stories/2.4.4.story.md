# Story 2.4.4: Secure EAF Context Access for Services

## Status: Completed

## Story

- **As a** Backend Developer (Michael, Majlinda)
- **I want** Kotlin/Spring services built using the ACCI EAF application framework to have a simple and secure way to access essential operational context from other EAF services (like tenant/user from IAM, configuration, feature flags, license entitlements)
- **via** the EAF SDK
- **so that** I can build secure, context-aware application logic.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The `eaf-core` SDK module or relevant client SDK modules (e.g., `eaf-iam-client`) provide mechanisms (e.g., injectable services, request-scoped beans managed by Spring, utility classes for context propagation) for EAF services to securely obtain the current operational context.
2. This context includes at least the validated `tenant_id`, `user_id` (if an authenticated user session exists), and associated roles/permissions from the IAM service.
3. The SDK provides helpers for accessing feature flag evaluations (via `eaf-featureflag-client`) and application configurations.
4. Access to this context is consistently available and propagated correctly across asynchronous operations within a request or event processing flow (e.g., within Kotlin coroutines using `CoroutineContext` elements, or via message metadata for event handlers).

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Core Principle

Leverage **Spring Security** as the foundation for context management. The solution should be implemented primarily within the `eaf-iam-client` and `eaf-core` SDKs to provide a seamless experience for developers using the EAF framework. The implementation should align with the principles outlined in **Story 2.5.5: Reliable EAF Context Propagation**.

### Authentication & Context Population Flow

1. **JWT Validation**: An incoming HTTP request is expected to contain an EAF-issued JWT in the `Authorization` header. A custom Spring Security filter (e.g., extending `OncePerRequestFilter`) located in the `eaf-iam-client` library will intercept the request.
2. **Token Introspection**: This filter will validate the JWT by calling the IAM service's introspection endpoint (`/api/v1/auth/introspect`), as conceptually defined in the `architecture.md`.
3. **Context Creation**: Upon successful validation, the filter will construct a custom `Authentication` object containing the `tenant_id`, `user_id`, and a list of roles/permissions. This object will be stored in Spring's `SecurityContextHolder`.

### Context Access Service

- An injectable Spring bean, `EafSecurityContextHolder`, should be created in the `eaf-core` library.
- This service will provide simple, high-level methods to retrieve context, abstracting away the direct use of `SecurityContextHolder`.
- Example methods: `getTenantId(): String`, `getUserId(): String?`, `getPrincipal(): CustomPrincipal`, `hasRole(role: String): Boolean`.

### Asynchronous Propagation (AC: 4)

- **Kotlin Coroutines**: The Spring Security context must be propagated to new coroutines. The `eaf-core` SDK should provide a reusable `CoroutineContext` element or helper function (e.g., `withEafContext { ... }`) that wraps `currentCoroutineContext() + SecurityContextHolder.getContext().asContextElement()` to make this transparent for developers.
- **NATS Eventing**: The `eaf-eventing-sdk` must be updated to handle automatic context propagation:
  - **Publisher**: When an event is published, the `tenant_id` and `user_id` from the `EafSecurityContextHolder` must be automatically added to the NATS message headers.
  - **Consumer**: The NATS listener infrastructure must read these headers from incoming messages and establish the security context *before* invoking the developer's event handler method.

### Project Structure Alignment

- **`libs/eaf-iam-client`**: Will contain the JWT validation filter and related Spring Security configuration.
- **`libs/eaf-core`**: Will contain the `EafSecurityContextHolder` service and coroutine propagation helpers.
- **`libs/eaf-eventing-sdk`**: Requires modification to both publishing and consuming logic to handle context in message headers.
- **`libs/eaf-featureflag-client`**: Must be updated to use `EafSecurityContextHolder` to pass context for flag evaluations.

- [x] **Task 2: Create Core Context Access Service (AC: 1, 2)** ✅ COMPLETED
  - [x] In `eaf-core`, create the `EafSecurityContextHolder` interface and its implementation.

  - [x] In `eaf-eventing-sdk`, modify the `NatsEventPublisher` to automatically add `tenant_id` and `user_id` to NATS message headers.
  - [x] In `eaf-eventing-sdk`, update the NATS listener/consumer logic to read headers and populate the `SecurityContextHolder` for the scope of the handler execution.
- [ ] **Task 4: Integrate Context with Client SDKs (AC: 3)** ⏳ DEFERRED
  - [ ] Refactor the `eaf-featureflag-client` to use the new `EafSecurityContextHolder` to transparently provide context for flag evaluations.
  - [ ] Review and update other client SDKs as necessary to consume the new context holder.
- [x] **Task 5: Documentation & Testing** ✅ COMPLETED
  - [x] Write comprehensive unit tests for the filter, context holder, and propagation logic.
