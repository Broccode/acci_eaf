# Story 4.1.8: Security-Tenant Context Integration Bridge

## Status: To Do

## Story

- **As a** Developer
- **I want** to create an integration bridge between `EafSecurityContextHolder` and `TenantContextHolder` that automatically synchronizes tenant context from Spring Security authentication
- **so that** tenant context is seamlessly available to all components without manual intervention, leveraging our existing security infrastructure.

## Background

This story implements the deferred Task 4 from Story 4.1.3. With the core `TenantContextHolder` complete and existing `EafSecurityContextHolder` + JWT infrastructure in place, we need to create an integration bridge that automatically synchronizes tenant context between these systems for seamless operation.

**Key Insight**: Rather than creating new filters, we integrate existing systems to work together efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A `SecurityTenantContextBridge` component automatically synchronizes tenant context from Spring Security to `TenantContextHolder`.
2. The bridge works with existing `EafSecurityContextHolder` and `JwtAuthenticationFilter` infrastructure.
3. Tenant context is automatically set early in the request processing lifecycle.
4. Async processing and coroutines maintain proper tenant context inheritance.
5. The integration provides fallback mechanisms and graceful error handling.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Create SecurityTenantContextBridge Component** (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create `SecurityTenantContextBridge.kt` in `libs/eaf-core/src/main/kotlin/com/axians/eaf/core/tenancy/integration/`
  - [ ] Implement bridge component that reads from `EafSecurityContextHolder` and sets `TenantContextHolder`
  - [ ] Add automatic tenant context synchronization on security context changes
  - [ ] Integrate with Spring Security's `SecurityContextHolder` events
  - [ ] Ensure bridge respects existing tenant context if already set
  - [ ] Add comprehensive logging for tenant synchronization operations

- [ ] **Task 2: Request Processing Integration** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create `TenantContextSynchronizationFilter` extending `OncePerRequestFilter`
  - [ ] Position filter after authentication but before business logic filters
  - [ ] Use `SecurityTenantContextBridge` to synchronize tenant context per request
  - [ ] Implement proper cleanup in `finally` block to prevent context leaks
  - [ ] Handle cases where Spring Security context is not yet established
  - [ ] Add request-level tenant context validation and error handling

- [ ] **Task 3: Spring Boot Auto-Configuration** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create `TenantContextIntegrationAutoConfiguration` in `libs/eaf-core`
  - [ ] Auto-register bridge component and filter in appropriate order
  - [ ] Add configuration properties for tenant context integration behavior
  - [ ] Implement conditional bean creation based on available security components
  - [ ] Ensure compatibility with different Spring Security configurations
  - [ ] Add profile-based configuration for test environments

- [ ] **Task 4: Enhanced Async/Coroutine Support** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Enhance existing `TenantCoroutineContext` to work with security context bridge
  - [ ] Create `SecurityAwareTenantExecutor` for `@Async` method tenant propagation
  - [ ] Implement automatic tenant context inheritance for `CompletableFuture` operations
  - [ ] Add support for Spring's `@Scheduled` methods with proper tenant context
  - [ ] Ensure WebFlux compatibility for reactive Spring applications
  - [ ] Create utilities for manual tenant context propagation in complex scenarios

- [ ] **Task 5: Fallback and Error Handling** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Implement graceful fallback when Spring Security context is unavailable
  - [ ] Add support for header-based tenant context as secondary source (`X-Tenant-ID`)
  - [ ] Create tenant context validation with clear error messages
  - [ ] Handle edge cases: missing tenant claims, invalid tenant IDs, context conflicts
  - [ ] Add security measures to prevent tenant context manipulation
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting and abuse detection for tenant context operations

- [ ] **Task 6: Integration Testing and Validation**
  - [ ] Create integration tests validating end-to-end tenant context flow
  - [ ] Test integration with existing `JwtAuthenticationFilter` and security infrastructure
  - [ ] Validate async processing maintains correct tenant context
  - [ ] Test fallback mechanisms and error scenarios
  - [ ] Verify performance impact is minimal under load
  - [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage for all integration scenarios

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Module Location**: `libs/eaf-core/src/main/kotlin/com/axians/eaf/core/tenancy/integration/`
- **Dependencies Required**: Add to `libs/eaf-core/build.gradle.kts`:

  ```kotlin
  implementation(libs.spring.security.core)
  implementation(libs.spring.web) // For OncePerRequestFilter
  implementation(libs.spring.boot.autoconfigure)
  ```

- **Integration Pattern**:
  - **Primary Source**: `EafSecurityContextHolder.getTenantIdOrNull()`
  - **Fallback**: Request headers (`X-Tenant-ID`)
  - **Target**: `TenantContextHolder.setCurrentTenantId()`
- **Filter Order**: Position after `JwtAuthenticationFilter` but before business logic
- **Performance**: Bridge should add <1ms overhead per request
- **Compatibility**: Must work with existing security configurations in both Control Plane and IAM Service

## Architecture Alignment

This story aligns with completed Epic 4.1 components:

- **✅ TenantContextHolder** (4.1.3): Core tenant context management
- **✅ EafSecurityContextHolder**: Existing Spring Security integration
- **✅ JwtAuthenticationFilter**: Existing JWT processing
- **✅ SecurityContext Infrastructure**: Existing authentication patterns

**Integration Points**:

1. `EafSecurityContextHolder` → `SecurityTenantContextBridge` → `TenantContextHolder`
2. `JwtAuthenticationFilter` → Spring Security → Bridge → Thread Context
3. Request Processing → Context Sync → Business Logic
4. Async Operations → Context Inheritance → Child Threads/Coroutines

## Testing Guidance

- **Objective**: Verify seamless integration between Spring Security and tenant context management
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  - **Integration Tests**:
    - End-to-end request processing with JWT authentication
    - Tenant context synchronization across filter chain
    - Bridge behavior with different authentication states
    - Integration with existing security aspects and annotations
  - **Async/Coroutine Tests**:
    - `@Async` method tenant context inheritance
    - Coroutine tenant context propagation
    - `CompletableFuture` operations with tenant context
    - Spring `@Scheduled` method tenant context handling
  - **Security Tests**:
    - Tenant context isolation between concurrent requests
    - Protection against tenant context manipulation
    - Graceful handling of invalid/missing tenant claims
    - Rate limiting for tenant context operations
  - **Fallback Tests**:
    - Header-based tenant extraction when JWT unavailable
    - Bridge behavior during authentication failures
    - Context cleanup and memory leak prevention
    - Performance under high-concurrency scenarios
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Zero manual tenant context setup required in business logic
  - Automatic tenant context availability in all processing scenarios
  - No performance degradation compared to current implementation
  - 100% compatibility with existing security infrastructure
- **Tools**: Spring Boot Test, Spring Security Test, TestContainers, MockK, JMeter for performance testing

## Expected Integration Flow

sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant JwtFilter as JwtAuthenticationFilter
    participant Security as EafSecurityContextHolder
    participant Bridge as SecurityTenantContextBridge
    participant Context as TenantContextHolder
    participant Business as Business Logic

    Client->>JwtFilter: Request with JWT
    JwtFilter->>Security: Set Authentication
    Security->>Bridge: Tenant context available
    Bridge->>Context: Sync tenant to ThreadLocal
    Context->>Business: Tenant context ready
    Business->>Business: Execute with tenant isolation
    Bridge->>Context: Cleanup on request end
```

This integration ensures tenant context is automatically available throughout the request lifecycle while leveraging existing, proven security infrastructure.
