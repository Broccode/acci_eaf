# Story 4.3.4: Implement Given-When-Then Tests for User Aggregate

## Status: To Do

## Story
- **As a** Developer
- **I want** to write comprehensive unit tests for the `User` aggregate using Axon's testing fixtures
- **so that** I can verify the aggregate's business logic in isolation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Unit tests are created using Axon's `AggregateTestFixture`.
2. Tests follow the Given-When-Then pattern for all command scenarios.
3. Tests verify that commands produce the correct events with the expected payloads.
4. Tests validate that invalid commands (e.g., creating a user with invalid data) are rejected with appropriate exceptions.
5. Tests verify that the aggregate can be reconstructed correctly from its event stream.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Set up Axon Test Infrastructure** (AC: 1)

  - [ ] Test complete user lifecycle (create → activate → change role → deactivate)
  - [ ] Test concurrent command scenarios
  - [ ] Test business rule enforcement across multiple commands
  - [ ] Test edge cases and boundary conditions
  - [ ] Test aggregate behavior with large event streams

- [ ] **Task 8: Performance and Load Testing**

  - [ ] Test event stream processing performance

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Test Location**: `apps/acci-eaf-control-plane/src/test/kotlin/com/axians/eaf/controlplane/domain/model/`
- **Dependencies Required**: Add to test dependencies:
  ```kotlin
  testImplementation(libs.axon.test)
  testImplementation(libs.junit.jupiter)
  testImplementation(libs.assertj.core)
  testImplementation(libs.mockk)
  ```
- **Test Fixture Setup Pattern**:
  ```kotlin
  class UserAggregateTest {
      private lateinit var fixture: AggregateTestFixture<User>
      
      @BeforeEach
      fun setUp() {
          fixture = AggregateTestFixture.newInstance(User::class.java)
      }
  }
  ```
- **Given-When-Then Test Structure**:
  ```kotlin
  @Test
  fun `should create user when command is valid`() {
      fixture.givenNoPriorActivity()
          .when(CreateUserCommand(...))
          .expectEvents(UserCreatedEvent(...))
  }
  
  @Test
  fun `should activate user when user exists`() {
      fixture.given(UserCreatedEvent(...))
          .when(ActivateUserCommand(...))
          .expectEvents(UserActivatedEvent(...))
  }
  ```
- **Exception Testing Pattern**:
  ```kotlin
  @Test
  fun `should reject creation with invalid email`() {
      fixture.givenNoPriorActivity()
          .when(CreateUserCommand(email = "invalid-email"))
          .expectException(InvalidEmailException::class.java)
  }
  ```
- **Event Payload Validation**: Use custom matchers for event verification:
  ```kotlin
  fixture.given(...)
      .when(...)
      .expectEventsMatching(
          payloadsMatching(
              exactMatch(UserCreatedEvent::class.java) { event ->
                  event.email == "user@example.com" &&
                  event.status == UserStatus.PENDING
              }
          )
      )
  ```
- **Test Data Builders**: Create builders for consistent test data:
  ```kotlin
  object UserTestData {
      fun createUserCommand(
          email: String = "user@example.com",
          username: String = "testuser"
      ) = CreateUserCommand(...)
  }
  ```

## Testing Guidance

- **Objective**: Achieve comprehensive test coverage for aggregate behavior while maintaining fast, isolated unit tests
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  - **Happy Path Scenarios**:
    - Complete user lifecycle operations
    - Standard business operations with valid data
    - Expected event production and payload verification
    - State transitions following business rules
  - **Edge Case Scenarios**:
    - Boundary value testing for all input fields
    - Maximum and minimum data values
    - Unicode and special character handling
    - Null and empty value handling
  - **Error Scenarios**:
    - Invalid command data and format
    - Business rule violations
    - Aggregate state violations
    - Concurrent modification scenarios
  - **Event Sourcing Scenarios**:
    - Aggregate reconstruction from events
    - Event ordering and consistency
    - Large event stream handling
    - Partial event stream reconstruction
- **Test Coverage Requirements**:
  - 100% line coverage for command handlers
  - 100% line coverage for event sourcing handlers
  - Complete business rule validation coverage
  - All exception scenarios tested
- **Performance Test Guidelines**:
  - Single test execution <100ms
  - Event reconstruction with 1000+ events <1s
  - Memory usage stable during large event replay
  - No memory leaks in test execution
- **Business Logic Verification**:
  - All domain rules enforced correctly
  - State transitions follow business requirements
  - Event payloads contain complete and accurate data
  - Business exceptions provide meaningful messages
- **Event Sourcing Verification**:
  - Aggregate state correctly reconstructed from events
  - Event handlers are deterministic and side-effect free
  - Event ordering doesn't break aggregate consistency
  - Aggregate invariants maintained after all operations
- **Test Quality Standards**:
  - Tests are readable and maintainable
  - Each test focuses on single behavior
  - Test names clearly describe expected behavior
  - Test setup is minimal and focused
- **Tools**: Axon Test Framework, JUnit 5, AssertJ for fluent assertions, custom domain test builders, property-based testing with Kotest for edge cases
