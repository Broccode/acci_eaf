# Story 2.3: EAF NATS SDK - Event Publishing

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a Backend Developer (Majlinda), I want to use the ACCI EAF SDK (Kotlin/Spring) to easily and
  reliably publish domain events (as JSON payloads) from my service to a NATS JetStream stream with
  an at-least-once delivery guarantee, ensuring that critical business events are captured and
  broadcast.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The `eaf-eventing-sdk` module provides a `NatsEventPublisher` service (or equivalent
   abstraction).
2. The publisher service connects to NATS using centrally managed EAF application configuration and
   correctly uses tenant-specific credentials or NATS context.
3. The publisher service accepts a Kotlin domain event object, serializes it to a JSON string as per
   EAF-defined conventions (e.g., including event type, timestamp, payload).
4. The SDK utilizes JetStream `publish()` method and correctly handles the returned `PublishAck` to
   ensure at-least-once delivery semantics, including configurable retry mechanisms for transient
   publish failures detectable via `PublishAck`.
5. All published events MUST include `tenant_id` (e.g., in NATS subject or message
   metadata/headers), propagated correctly by the SDK, aligning with the NATS multi-tenancy
   architecture defined by Fred.
6. (Conditional) If Story 2.2 (Transactional Outbox) is implemented, this SDK publisher integrates
   with it seamlessly.
7. Comprehensive unit and integration tests (using Testcontainers for NATS) demonstrate successful
   publishing, `PublishAck` handling, tenant context usage, and error scenarios.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Setup `eaf-eventing-sdk` module**

  - [x] If not present, create the `libs/eaf-sdk/eaf-eventing-sdk` Gradle sub-project within the Nx
        monorepo.
  - [x] Add necessary dependencies: `spring-boot-starter`, NATS client (`io.nats:jnats`), Jackson
        for JSON, and testing libraries.
  - [x] Define a `NatsEventPublisher` interface as the primary public API of the SDK.

- [x] **Task 2: Implement `NatsEventPublisher` Service**

  - [x] Create a default implementation of `NatsEventPublisher`, managed as a Spring bean.
  - [x] Implement NATS connection logic that is configurable via Spring Boot properties
        (`application.yml`), covering server URL, user credentials, etc. This should support the
        multi-tenant credential setup from Story 2.1.
  - [x] The service should handle connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, reconnect).

- [x] **Task 3: Implement Event Serialization & Publishing Method**

  - [x] Define the `publish` method on the `NatsEventPublisher` interface. It should accept
        parameters like `subject`, `tenantId`, and the event payload (as a Kotlin `Any` object).
  - [x] Implement logic to serialize the Kotlin event object into a JSON string. An EAF standard
        event envelope (e.g., with `eventId`, `eventType`, `timestamp`, `tenantId`, `payload`)
        should be used.
  - [x] The `publish` method should construct the final NATS subject using the `tenantId` (e.g.,
        `TENANT_A.events.some-event`).

- [x] **Task 4: Ensure At-Least-Once Delivery with JetStream**

  - [x] Utilize the JetStream API (`jetStream.publish()`) for publishing.
  - [x] Implement logic to handle the `PublishAck` returned by JetStream.
  - [x] Implement a configurable retry mechanism (e.g., number of retries, backoff delay) for cases
        where `publish()` fails or a negative `PublishAck` is received.

- [x] **Task 5: Implement Testing Suite**

  - [x] Write unit tests for the `NatsEventPublisher` implementation, mocking the NATS client and
        other dependencies to verify serialization and retry logic.
  - [x] Write integration tests using Testcontainers to spin up a real NATS server.
  - [x] Integration tests must cover:
    - [x] Successful publishing and `PublishAck` handling.
    - [x] Correct use of tenant context and credentials for publishing.
    - [x] Publishing to tenant-specific subjects.
    - [x] Graceful handling of error scenarios (e.g., NATS server unavailable, invalid credentials).

- [x] **Task 6: Document SDK Usage**
  - [x] Create or update documentation in "The Launchpad" (`docs/docusaurus-docs`).
  - [x] Document how to configure the `NatsEventPublisher` in an EAF service.
  - [x] Provide clear code examples for publishing events using the SDK.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Location:** All new code should be within the `libs/eaf-sdk/eaf-eventing-sdk/` module.
- **Technology Stack:** Kotlin, Spring Boot, NATS Java Client (`jnats`), Jackson JSON, JUnit 5,
  MockK, Testcontainers.
- **Multi-Tenancy:** This is a critical aspect. The SDK must make it easy and safe to publish events
  within the correct tenant context. The `tenant_id` should likely be an explicit parameter to the
  `publish` method to avoid ambiguity. The SDK should then enforce its inclusion in the NATS
  subject, aligning with the pattern `TENANT_ID.stream.event`.
- **Reliability:** The core value of this SDK is reliable, at-least-once publishing. The
  `PublishAck` handling and retry logic are non-negotiable features.
- **Configuration:** All aspects like NATS connection details and retry policies should be
  configurable via standard Spring Boot mechanisms (`application.yml`/`.properties`).
- **Conditional Story 2.2:** The design should be clean enough to allow for future integration with
  a transactional outbox pattern if Story 2.2 is implemented. This means the core
  `NatsEventPublisher` might be decorated or replaced by an outbox-aware publisher later.
