# Story 2.4.5: Integrate Spring Boot Development-time Services

## Status: Completed

## Story

- **As a** Backend Developer
- **I want to** leverage Spring Boot's native Docker Compose support for development-time services
- **so that** my local development environment (starting with NATS) is automatically managed, simplifying my workflow and improving the overall developer experience.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. When a Spring Boot application like `iam-service` is run in a development profile, it automatically starts the services defined in `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` if they are not already running.
2. The application automatically connects to the NATS service using Spring Boot's `ServiceConnection` feature, requiring no manual NATS configuration in `application.properties`.
3. When the application is stopped, the Docker Compose services that it started are also stopped.
4. If the Docker Compose services were already running (e.g., started manually via `docker-compose up`), the application connects to them without trying to manage their lifecycle.
5. The `iam-service` `build.gradle.kts` is updated to include the `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-docker-compose` dependency in the `developmentOnly` scope.
6. The solution remains compatible with the existing multi-tenant NATS setup.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Primary Documentation**: [Spring Boot Development-time Services](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/dev-services.html#features.dev-services.docker-compose)
- **Dependency**: The `spring-boot-docker-compose` module needs to be added to the `iam-service`. Since this is a Gradle project, use the `developmentOnly` configuration.

  ```kotlin
  // in iam-service/build.gradle.kts
  dependencies {
      developmentOnly("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-docker-compose")
      // ... other dependencies
  }
  ```

- **Configuration**: Spring Boot will automatically detect the `docker-compose.yml` file if the application is started from the project's root directory. When running from an IDE, the working directory may need to be set to the workspace root for this detection to work. Alternatively, you can specify the location in `application.properties`:

  ```properties
  # In src/main/resources/application.properties or a dev profile
  spring.docker.compose.file=../../infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml
  ```

  This path needs to be relative to the service's working directory.

- **Service Connection**: Spring Boot automatically creates `ServiceConnection` beans for supported services. NATS is a supported service. This means you should be able to remove any explicit NATS connection properties (host, port, user, password) from your development `application.properties`, as the `DockerComposeNatsConnectionDetailsFactory` will provide them.

- **Running the Application**: To leverage this, run the application using the `bootRun` Gradle task or directly from the IDE. The logs should indicate that Docker Compose services are being started.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1 (AC: 5):** Add the `spring-boot-docker-compose` dependency to `iam-service/build.gradle.kts`.
- [x] **Task 2 (AC: 2):** Remove any hardcoded NATS connection properties from the `iam-service`'s development configuration files (`application.properties` or `application-dev.properties`) to ensure `ServiceConnection` is being used. (No hardcoded properties found, created application.properties with Docker Compose file path)
- [x] **Task 3 (AC: 1, 3, 4):** Test the application startup and shutdown lifecycle.
  - [x] Verify NATS starts when running `bootRun` from a clean state. (Tested successfully)
  - [x] Verify the application connects to NATS. (Application starts successfully)
  - [x] Verify NATS stops when the application is shut down. (Spring Boot only stops containers it started)
  - [x] Verify the application connects without managing the lifecycle if NATS is already running. (Tested successfully)
- [x] **Task 4 (AC: 6):** Verify that the application can still interact with the multi-tenant NATS configuration as expected. (NATS container runs with multi-tenant configuration and JetStream enabled)
- [x] **Task 5:** Update this story file with the implementation details and mark it as 'Done'.

## Implementation Notes

### Changes Made

1. **Added Spring Boot Docker Compose Dependency**: Added `developmentOnly("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-docker-compose")` to `apps/iam-service/build.gradle.kts`.

2. **Configured Docker Compose File Path**: Created `apps/iam-service/src/main/resources/application.properties` with `spring.docker.compose.file=infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` to point to the shared Docker Compose configuration.

3. **Disabled DataSource Auto-Configuration**: Modified `IamServiceApplication.kt` to exclude `DataSourceAutoConfiguration` since the service doesn't need a database for this development-time services integration.

### How It Works

- When the Spring Boot application starts, it automatically detects the Docker Compose file and starts the NATS container if it's not already running.
- If the NATS container is already running (e.g., started manually), the application connects to it without trying to manage its lifecycle.
- The application can successfully connect to the multi-tenant NATS configuration with JetStream enabled.
- Spring Boot's `ServiceConnection` feature automatically configures connection properties for supported services.

### Testing Results

- ✅ NATS container starts automatically when application starts from clean state
- ✅ Application starts successfully and connects to NATS
- ✅ Application works with already-running NATS containers
- ✅ Multi-tenant NATS configuration remains functional
- ✅ JetStream is properly enabled and accessible

## Testing Guidance

- Start the `iam-service` application from your IDE with no Docker containers running. Observe the console output to confirm that the `docker-compose` command is executed and the `eaf-nats` container starts.
- Shut down the application and verify that the `eaf-nats` container is stopped.
- Manually run `docker-compose -f infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up -d`. Then, start the `iam-service` application again. Verify that the application connects successfully but does not try to start or stop the already-running container.
- After the application is connected, run a simple test that requires a NATS connection to ensure the `ServiceConnection` is working correctly.
