# Story 1.3: Implement Initial ArchUnit Test Suite for Core Architectural Rules

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As the EAF Development Team
- I want an initial ArchUnit test suite integrated into the CI pipeline, with core rules for layer
  dependencies (Hexagonal) and naming conventions
- so that architectural integrity is programmatically enforced.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1:** ArchUnit dependency (`archunit-junit5-api`, `archunit-junit5-engine`) is added to the
   `build.gradle.kts` test configurations of all relevant backend modules (e.g., `iam-service`,
   `eaf-sdk/eaf-core`, and any new service generated by the CLI).
2. **AC2:** An initial ArchUnit test suite is created (e.g., in a shared test utility library like
   `libs/eaf-sdk/eaf-test-utils` or within a core EAF module like
   `libs/eaf-sdk/eaf-core/src/test/kotlin/com/axians/eaf/core/arch`). This suite should be easily
   discoverable and extensible.
3. **AC3:** Layer dependency tests verify:
   - Domain packages (e.g., `com.axians.eaf.{service}.domain.model`,
     `com.axians.eaf.{service}.domain.port`) do not depend on application packages (e.g.,
     `com.axians.eaf.{service}.application.*`) or infrastructure packages (e.g.,
     `com.axians.eaf.{service}.infrastructure.*`, `org.springframework.*`, `jakarta.persistence.*`).
   - Application packages (e.g., `com.axians.eaf.{service}.application.service`,
     `com.axians.eaf.{service}.application.port.*`) do not depend on infrastructure packages.
   - Application ports (inbound/outbound) are interfaces and reside in appropriate application
     packages (e.g., `application.port.in`, `application.port.out`).
4. **AC4:** Naming convention tests verify:
   - Classes annotated with `@Service` (Spring) reside in `application.service` packages and have
     names ending with `Service`.
   - Classes implementing inbound ports reside in `infrastructure.adapter.in` packages and have
     names ending with `Adapter` or `Controller`.
   - Classes implementing outbound ports reside in `infrastructure.adapter.out` packages and have
     names ending with `Adapter` or `Repository`.
   - Domain entities and aggregates reside in `domain.model` packages.
   - Commands and Events reside in `domain.command` and `domain.event` (or `application.port.in` for
     commands, `domain.event` for events if following PRD structure for CLI generation).
5. **AC5:** ArchUnit tests are successfully executed as part of the CI pipeline (GitLab CI and
   GitHub Actions) for all affected backend modules during the `nx affected:test --all` stage. The
   build must fail if any ArchUnit test fails.
6. **AC6:** The "Launchpad" Developer Portal includes a page under "Architectural Principles" or
   "Testing" documenting the purpose of ArchUnit tests in ACCI EAF, how to run them locally, and
   guidance on how to add new architectural rules.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Add ArchUnit Dependencies** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add `archunit-junit5-api` and `archunit-junit5-engine` to the centralized dependency version management.
- [x] Update root `build.gradle.kts` or individual module `build.gradle.kts` files (for
        `iam-service`, `eaf-sdk/eaf-core`, and templates used by CLI for new services) to include
        these dependencies in `testImplementation`.
- [x] **Task 2: Create Initial ArchUnit Test Suite Structure** (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Create base ArchUnit test class in
        `libs/eaf-sdk/eaf-core/src/test/kotlin/.../arch/EafArchitectureTest.kt`.
  - [x] Implement core architectural rules for Hexagonal Architecture layer separation.
  - [x] Implement naming convention rules for domain components (Events, Commands, Aggregates,
        etc.).
  - [x] Create service-specific ArchUnit test in
        `apps/iam-service/src/test/kotlin/.../arch/IamServiceArchitectureTest.kt`.
  - [x] Ensure all tests pass and are appropriate for current MVP state (using
        `allowEmptyShould(true)`).
- [x] **Task 3: Implement Layer Dependency Rules** (AC: 3)
  - [x] Define rules to enforce Hexagonal Architecture layers:
    - [x] Domain layer must not depend on infrastructure layer
    - [x] Domain layer must not depend on Spring Framework or Spring Boot
    - [x] Domain layer must not depend on persistence frameworks
  - [x] Application layer constraints (implemented in service-specific tests)
- [x] **Task 4: Implement Naming Convention Rules** (AC: 4)
  - [x] Define rules for domain components:
    - [x] Classes ending with "Aggregate" should be in domain model packages
    - [x] Classes ending with "Event" should be in domain event packages
    - [x] Classes ending with "Command" should be in appropriate packages
  - [x] Define rules for service classes and components location
  - [x] Define rules for test classes and architectural test organization
- [x] **Task 5: Integrate ArchUnit Tests into CI Pipeline** (AC: 5)
  - [x] Confirm ArchUnit tests run as part of `gradle test` or `nx affected:test --all`.
  - [x] Verify that a failing ArchUnit test causes the CI build to fail in both GitLab CI and GitHub
        Actions.
- [x] **Task 6: Document ArchUnit Usage in "The Launchpad"** (AC: 6)
  - [x] Create comprehensive ArchUnit documentation in `docs/operational-guidelines.md`.
  - [x] Explain the importance of ArchUnit in maintaining architectural integrity.
  - [x] Provide instructions on how developers can add new rules.
  - [x] Link to the actual ArchUnit test code and provide examples.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **ArchUnit Documentation:** Refer to the official ArchUnit user guide:
  [https://www.archunit.org/userguide/html/000_Index.html](https://www.archunit.org/userguide/html/000_Index.html)
- **Hexagonal Architecture:** Rules should enforce the principles outlined in the
  `docs/architecture.md` and align with the structure generated by the `acci-eaf-cli` (Story 2.6.1).
  - Domain: `com.axians.eaf.{service}.domain.model`, `com.axians.eaf.{service}.domain.port` (if
    ports defined here)
  - Application: `com.axians.eaf.{service}.application.service`,
    `com.axians.eaf.{service}.application.port.in`, `com.axians.eaf.{service}.application.port.out`
  - Infrastructure: `com.axians.eaf.{service}.infrastructure.adapter.in.web`,
    `com.axians.eaf.{service}.infrastructure.adapter.out.persistence`,
    `com.axians.eaf.{service}.infrastructure.adapter.out.messaging`
- **Naming Conventions:** As per `docs/architecture.md` (Coding Standards section) and general
  Spring/Java best practices.
  - Services: `*Service` in `application.service` package.
  - Adapters: `*Adapter`, `*Controller`, `*Repository` in respective `infrastructure.adapter.*`
    packages.
- **Test Location:** Consider a dedicated shared module for common architectural rules if they are
  to be applied across many services (e.g., `libs/eaf-arch-rules`). Project-specific architectural
  rules can reside within the project's test sources. For MVP, centralizing in `eaf-core` or a new
  `eaf-test-utils` library under `eaf-sdk` might be simpler.
- **CI Integration:** Ensure ArchUnit tests are standard JUnit 5 tests so they are picked up
  automatically by Gradle's test task, which is then called by Nx.
- **Package Naming:** Rules should be flexible enough to handle variations like
  `com.axians.eaf.productx.iam...` if services become more deeply nested under a product. The
  current pattern is `com.axians.eaf.{serviceName}.{layer}`.
- **Spring Annotations:** Rules might need to check for annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`,
  `@Repository`, `@RestController`, etc., and their allowed locations.
