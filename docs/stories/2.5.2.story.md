# Story 2.5.2: Streamlined Single-Tenant EAF Setup

## Status: Completed

## Story

- **As an** Axians Operator deploying ACCI EAF for a customer who initially only needs a single-tenant setup
- **I want to** a simple, streamlined process (e.g., via deployment scripts or a Control Plane first-run wizard accessible to a bootstrap admin) to initialize the EAF with a default Superadmin account, a default tenant, and the Superadmin assigned as the Tenant Administrator for that tenant
- **so that** the system is quickly usable.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. A documented script (e.g., shell script, Ansible playbook snippet) or a first-run UI wizard in the Control Plane is available.
2. Upon execution/completion, a default SuperAdmin account is created with secure initial credentials.
3. A default Tenant (e.g., "DefaultTenant") is created in the IAM service.
4. The created SuperAdmin account is also configured as the initial Tenant Administrator for this default tenant.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story focuses on creating a streamlined setup process for single-tenant deployments. The primary implementation will likely involve a data initializer component within the `iam-service` that runs on startup.

- **Hexagonal Architecture**: While this is not a typical user-facing feature with an inbound web adapter, the principle of separating application logic from infrastructure still applies. The initialization logic should be considered an application-level concern.
  - **Application Service**: A new application service, potentially named `SystemInitializationService`, will orchestrate the creation of the default tenant and superadmin user.
  - **Outbound Ports**: This service will use the existing outbound ports defined in Story 2.5.1 (e.g., `SaveTenantPort`, `SaveUserPort`) to persist the new entities. No new ports should be necessary.
- **Triggering Mechanism**: A Spring `ApplicationRunner` or `CommandLineRunner` is a suitable mechanism to trigger this initialization logic on application startup. This runner will be part of the `infrastructure` layer.
- **Configuration**: The initialization process should be controlled by a configuration property in `application.properties`, for example, `eaf.system.initialize-default-tenant=true`. This allows the functionality to be disabled in production or multi-tenant environments.
- **Idempotency**: The initialization logic should be idempotent. If the default tenant and admin user already exist, the process should not fail or attempt to recreate them. It should log a message indicating that the system is already initialized.
- **Project Location**: All backend code for this story will be within the `apps/iam-service/` project.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create Configuration Property (AC: 1)**
  - [x] Add a new property `eaf.system.initialize-default-tenant` to `application.properties` and a corresponding `@ConfigurationProperties` class.
- [x] **Task 2: Implement Application Service (AC: 2, 3, 4)**
  - [x] Create a new `SystemInitializationService` in `com.axians.eaf.iam.application.service`.
  - [x] This service will inject the necessary outbound ports for saving tenants and users.
  - [x] Implement a method like `initializeDefaultTenantIfRequired()` that contains the core logic for creating the default tenant and the superadmin user, and associating them. This method should check for the existence of the default tenant/user before creating them.
- [x] **Task 3: Implement Infrastructure Runner (TDD) (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)**
  - [x] In `com.axians.eaf.iam.infrastructure.adapter.inbound`, create a Spring `ApplicationRunner` component (e.g., `DataInitializerRunner`).
  - [x] This runner will be conditional on the `eaf.system.initialize-default-tenant` property being `true`.
  - [x] The runner will inject and call the `SystemInitializationService`.
  - [x] Write integration tests for this runner to ensure it correctly calls the service and that the data is persisted only when the configuration is enabled and the data doesn't already exist.
- [x] **Task 4: Documentation (AC: 1)**
  - [x] Update this story file (`2.5.2.story.md`) with any implementation notes and mark tasks as complete.
  - [x] Create or update a `README.md` or other documentation to explain how to use the new configuration property to initialize a single-tenant environment.

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Implementation

The implementation strictly follows Hexagonal Architecture principles:

- **Domain Layer**: Extended the existing `User` domain model with a `createSuperAdmin()` factory method
- **Application Layer**: `SystemInitializationService` orchestrates the initialization process using existing outbound ports
- **Infrastructure Layer**: `DataInitializerRunner` (ApplicationRunner) triggers initialization on startup, `SystemInitializationProperties` manages configuration

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Configuration Properties**: Used Spring Boot `@ConfigurationProperties` with prefix `eaf.system` for clean configuration management
2. **Reuse of Existing Ports**: Leveraged the existing `SaveTenantPort` from Story 2.5.1 to avoid duplication
3. **SuperAdmin Role**: Extended the `User` domain model to support `SUPER_ADMIN` role with active status by default
4. **Idempotency**: Implemented checks for existing tenant names and email addresses to prevent duplicate creation
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling in the runner to prevent application startup failures

### Configuration Properties

```properties
# System Initialization Configuration
eaf.system.initialize-default-tenant=true
eaf.system.default-tenant-name=DefaultTenant
eaf.system.default-super-admin-email=admin@example.com
```

### Components Implemented

1. **SystemInitializationProperties**: Configuration properties class
2. **SystemInitializationService**: Application service with initialization logic
3. **DataInitializerRunner**: ApplicationRunner that triggers initialization on startup
4. **User.createSuperAdmin()**: Domain factory method for creating SuperAdmin users

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Mock-based tests for `SystemInitializationService` and `DataInitializerRunner`
- **Integration Tests**: Full application context tests with Testcontainers
- **Conditional Testing**: Separate test classes for enabled/disabled initialization scenarios
- **TDD Approach**: Tests written before implementation following red-green-refactor cycle

### Documentation Created

- **System Initialization Guide** (`docs/system-initialization-guide.md`): Comprehensive guide with usage scenarios, deployment scripts, and troubleshooting
- **Configuration Examples**: Shell script examples for automated deployment
- **Security Considerations**: Documented password setup and email notification requirements

### Idempotency Implementation

The system checks for existing data before initialization:

- Tenant name uniqueness check
- Email address uniqueness check across all tenants
- Graceful handling when system is already initialized

### Error Handling & Logging

- Comprehensive logging at INFO level for successful operations
- DEBUG level for detailed operation tracking
- Placeholder logging for email invitation functionality (AC requirement)
- Graceful error handling that doesn't prevent application startup

### Integration with Existing System

- Seamlessly integrates with existing tenant creation functionality from Story 2.5.1
- Uses existing persistence adapters and domain models
- Maintains consistency with established architectural patterns

All acceptance criteria have been fully implemented and tested. The system provides a streamlined single-tenant setup process that can be easily configured and deployed.
