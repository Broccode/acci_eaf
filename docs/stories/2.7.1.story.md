# Story 2.7.1: "Getting Started" Guide on Launchpad

## Status: Completed

## Story

- **As a** New Developer (Lirika)
- **I want** a comprehensive "Getting Started" guide on "The Launchpad" Developer Portal that rapidly walks me through setting up my local development environment (including NATS, PostgreSQL via Docker Compose, IDE configuration for Kotlin/Spring and React/TS) and building/running a simple "hello world" style application using the ACCI EAF CLI and core MVP SDKs
- **so that** I can quickly become productive and understand the basic EAF workflow without extensive onboarding overhead.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **✅ "The Launchpad" Entry Point**: "The Launchpad" (Docusaurus site) hosts a "Getting Started" guide as a primary entry point with clear navigation and prominent placement.

2. **✅ Prerequisites & Environment Setup**: The guide includes comprehensive prerequisites and setup instructions for:
   - Kotlin/JDK (version 17+)
   - Spring Boot framework
   - Node.js (version 18+)
   - Docker & Docker Compose
   - Nx CLI and workspace management
   - Recommended IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA for backend, VS Code for frontend)
   - Git configuration and SSH keys

3. **✅ EAF CLI Service Generation**: Provides step-by-step instructions to use `acci-eaf-cli` to generate a new EAF service with:
   - Complete hexagonal architecture structure
   - Domain, application, and infrastructure layers properly separated
   - TDD setup with failing tests to guide implementation
   - EAF SDK integrations pre-configured

4. **✅ Infrastructure Setup**: Explains how to run the EAF services with local development infrastructure:
   - NATS message broker setup via Docker Compose
   - PostgreSQL database setup via Docker Compose
   - Connection configuration and validation
   - Troubleshooting common setup issues

5. **✅ Hello World Implementation**: Includes a minimal "hello world" example demonstrating:
   - A simple domain aggregate with creation command and event
   - Application service implementing a use case
   - REST controller endpoint
   - Event publication via NATS
   - Basic integration test

6. **✅ Local Development Workflow**: Covers running the generated application locally:
   - Using Gradle tasks via Nx for build/test/run
   - IDE integration and debugging setup
   - Hot reload and development server configuration
   - Log monitoring and debugging techniques

7. **✅ Frontend Integration**: Demonstrates frontend interaction with the backend:
   - React component consuming REST API
   - TypeScript integration patterns
   - Error handling and loading states
   - Basic state management approaches

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story focuses on creating comprehensive documentation in "The Launchpad" (Docusaurus portal) that enables rapid developer onboarding. The documentation must be practical, tested, and follow EAF architectural principles.

### 1. Documentation Structure & Organization

**Location**: `docs/docusaurus-docs/getting-started/`

Create a structured getting-started section:

```
getting-started/
├── index.md                    # Overview and quick navigation
├── prerequisites.md            # Environment setup requirements
├── local-setup.md             # Step-by-step local environment setup
├── first-service.md           # Creating your first EAF service
├── hello-world-example.md     # Complete hello world walkthrough
├── frontend-integration.md    # Frontend interaction patterns
├── development-workflow.md    # Day-to-day development practices
└── troubleshooting.md         # Common issues and solutions
```

**Navigation Integration**: Update `docs/sidebars.ts` to include the new getting-started section with proper hierarchy and positioning.

### 2. Content Development Principles

**Hexagonal Architecture Focus**: Every code example and service structure must demonstrate proper hexagonal architecture:

- Clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- Proper use of ports and adapters pattern
- Dependency inversion principles applied consistently

**Domain-Driven Design Integration**: Include guidance on:

- Domain modeling with aggregates, entities, and value objects
- Bounded context identification
- Event storming concepts for beginners
- Ubiquitous language usage

**Test-Driven Development**: All examples must follow TDD principles:

- Start with failing tests
- Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- Refactor with confidence
- Include both unit and integration test examples

### 3. Practical Hello World Example

**Domain**: Simple `UserProfile` aggregate for user onboarding

- `CreateUserProfileCommand`
- `UserProfileCreatedEvent`
- `UserProfile` aggregate root
- `UserProfileRepository` port

**Use Case**: "Register New User Profile"

- Input validation
- Domain rule enforcement
- Event publishing
- Error handling

**Infrastructure**:

- REST controller with proper error handling
- NATS event publisher
- In-memory repository for simplicity
- Integration test with TestContainers

### 4. Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

**Phase 4: Frontend Integration**

1. Create React component
2. Implement API client
3. Handle async operations
