# Story 1.2: Configure Nx Monorepo with Gradle Projects & Basic CI Workflow

## Status: Review

## Story

- As the EAF Development Team
- I want the Nx Monorepo configured with initial Gradle project structures for backend
  services/libraries and a basic CI workflow (build, lint, format, unit test affected projects,
  using GitLab CI as primary and GitHub Actions as secondary)
- so that we have a consistent and automated foundation for all EAF development.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. CI pipeline (primarily GitLab CI, with GitHub Actions as a secondary option) is defined and
   triggers on pushes/PRs to `main`.
2. CI pipeline executes `nx affected:build --all` and `nx affected:test --all` (or equivalent
   commands covering both backend and frontend projects recognized by Nx).
3. Spotless (with Ktlint or Kfmt, Ktlint preferred if no strong reason for Kfmt) for Kotlin
   formatting is integrated into the root Gradle build and enforced by the CI pipeline for all
   backend modules.
4. A frontend linting/formatting solution (defaulting to ESLint and Prettier if Biome evaluation is
   not conclusive for MVP) is configured for TypeScript/React in `libs/ui-foundation-kit/` and
   `apps/acci-eaf-control-plane/frontend/` (and any other future frontend projects) via
   workspace-level configuration and enforced by the CI pipeline.
5. The CI build fails if linting, formatting, or tests fail for any affected project.
6. Basic build artifacts (e.g., JARs for backend services including Hilla frontend, static
   assets/library package for `ui-foundation-kit` if built separately) are produced and archived by
   the CI pipeline for successful builds.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Setup CI Workflow (GitLab CI primary, GitHub Actions secondary)** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `.gitlab-ci.yml` for GitLab CI.
  - [x] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for GitHub Actions.
  - [x] Configure workflows to trigger on push/PR to `main` branch.
  - [x] Setup necessary environment (Java, Node.js, Gradle cache, Nx cache) in both CI
        configurations.
- [x] **Task 2: Integrate Nx Build & Test into CI** (AC: 2, 5)
  - [x] Add steps to both CI workflows to run `nx affected:build --all`.
  - [x] Add steps to both CI workflows to run `nx affected:test --all`.
  - [x] Ensure CI fails if these commands return non-zero exit codes in both systems.
- [x] **Task 3: Integrate Spotless for Kotlin Backend Formatting** (AC: 3, 5)
  - [x] Add/configure Spotless plugin with Ktlint in the root `build.gradle.kts` to apply to all
        Kotlin sub-projects.
  - [x] Ensure `gradle spotlessCheck` (or equivalent verification task) is run by both CI systems
        for backend projects.
  - [x] Ensure CI fails if formatting violations are detected in both systems.
- [x] **Task 4: Setup Frontend Linting/Formatting** (AC: 4, 5)
  - [x] **Subtask 4.1: Evaluate Biome**
    - [x] Briefly research Biome's current capabilities for TypeScript/React linting and formatting.
    - [x] Assess its maturity, Nx integration ease, and alignment with project goals compared to
          ESLint/Prettier.
    - [x] Decide if Biome is suitable for MVP or if ESLint/Prettier should be the default for now.
  - [x] **Subtask 4.2: Configure Chosen Linter/Formatter** (ESLint/Prettier as default)
    - [x] Based on 4.1, configure either Biome or ESLint/Prettier with appropriate rules for
          TypeScript/React in the root `package.json` and project-specific configurations if needed.
    - [x] Add Nx targets or npm scripts (e.g., `lint`, `format:check`) for frontend projects for the
          chosen tool.
  - [x] **Subtask 4.3: Integrate into CI**
    - [x] Ensure chosen linting/formatting checks are run by both CI systems for affected frontend
          projects.
    - [x] Ensure CI fails if violations are detected in both systems.
- [x] **Task 5: Configure Build Artifacts** (AC: 6)
  - [x] Configure both CI workflows to archive backend JARs (e.g., from `iam-service`,
        `acci-eaf-control-plane/backend/build/libs/`).
  - [x] Configure both CI workflows to archive frontend artifacts (e.g., `ui-foundation-kit` if
        packaged as a library, or confirm Hilla frontend assets are within the backend JAR for
        `acci-eaf-control-plane`).

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **CI Systems:** Use GitLab CI as the primary system and GitHub Actions as a secondary/alternative,
  as specified in `docs/infra-deployment.md`. Workflow files are typically `.gitlab-ci.yml` and
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` respectively.
- **Nx Integration:** Leverage Nx's `affected` commands (`nx affected:build --all`,
  `nx affected:test --all`) for efficiency in CI, as per `docs/tech-stack.md`. Ensure Nx caching is
  utilized in CI if possible for both systems.
- **Backend (Kotlin/Gradle):**
  - **Formatting:** Integrate Spotless with Ktlint (or Kfmt if there's a strong preference, Ktlint
    is generally aligned with Kotlin official conventions). Configuration should be in the root
    `build.gradle.kts` and apply to all Kotlin modules. See `docs/operational-guidelines.md` (Coding
    Standards section).
  - **Testing:** CI should execute tests defined (JUnit 5, MockK, ArchUnit).
  - **Artifacts:** Standard Gradle JAR outputs. For Hilla applications (like
    `acci-eaf-control-plane`), the frontend is typically bundled within the Spring Boot JAR.
- **Frontend (TypeScript/React - `ui-foundation-kit`, `acci-eaf-control-plane/frontend`):**
  - **Linting/Formatting:** Evaluate Biome first (Task 4.1). If not adopted for MVP, default to
    ESLint and Prettier. Workspace-level configurations for ESLint/Prettier are managed in the root
    `package.json` as per `docs/project-structure.md`. Project-specific configs might extend the
    root. If Biome is chosen, update `docs/project-structure.md` accordingly in a separate
    commit/task.
  - **`ui-foundation-kit` Structure:** This is a library in `libs/ui-foundation-kit/` with its own
    `package.json`. CI should build/test/lint this project. Its artifact might be an npm package or
    static library.
  - **`acci-eaf-control-plane/frontend` Structure:** Frontend code is in
    `apps/acci-eaf-control-plane/backend/src/main/frontend/` as per
    `docs/front-end-project-structure.md`. Its build, test, and linting are part of the
    `acci-eaf-control-plane` (likely its backend Gradle module) build lifecycle.
- **Failure Conditions:** Both CI pipelines must fail (non-zero exit code) if any build, test, lint,
  or format check fails (AC5).
- **Documentation Note:** `docs/front-end-coding-standards.md` does not explicitly mention
  ESLint/Prettier. `docs/project-structure.md` indicates ESLint/Prettier are expected at the
  workspace level. This story now includes an evaluation task for Biome; if Biome is not chosen for
  MVP, ESLint/Prettier will be the default, aligning with the current state of
  `project-structure.md`.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Gemini 2.5 Pro`

### Completion Notes List

**Biome Evaluation (Task 4.1):**

- **Decision: Use ESLint/Prettier for MVP**
- **Rationale:** While Biome shows significant promise with unified tooling and better performance,
  it's still rapidly evolving (written in Rust, much faster than ESLint/Prettier)
- **Key findings:** Biome currently lacks complete TypeScript rule coverage compared to
  typescript-eslint, has no official Nx integration documentation yet, and may introduce instability
  for MVP
- **Benefits noted:** Single dependency, unified config, better error messages, much faster
  execution
- **Recommendation:** Re-evaluate Biome for post-MVP iterations when it matures further

### Change Log

```
2024-12-20: Fixed GitHub Actions Java distribution name - changed 'eclipse-temurin' to 'temurin' 
           (eclipse-temurin is not recognized by actions/setup-java@v4, correct name is 'temurin')
2024-12-20: Fixed GitLab CI "413 Request Entity Too Large" error - removed node_modules/ and .gradle/ 
           from setup job artifacts (these should only be cached, not uploaded as artifacts)
           Also changed dependencies to needs for archive_artifacts job for better performance.
2024-12-20: Fixed GitLab CI "git: not found" error - added git installation to before_script 
           (eclipse-temurin:21-jdk image doesn't include git, but Nx affected commands require it)
2024-12-20: Fixed GitLab CI shallow clone issue - changed 'nx affected' to 'nx run-many' commands
           (GitLab CI shallow clone lacks main branch reference, so affected detection fails)
           Also updated GitHub Actions for consistency, using 'nx run-many' instead of 'nx affected'
```
