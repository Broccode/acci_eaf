# Story 2.8.1: Define and Scope Pilot Service/Module

## Status: Complete

## Story

- **As the** EAF Product Team (John, Fred, Jane, Sarah)
- **I want to** clearly define and agree upon the scope, functional requirements, and success criteria for a small, representative pilot service/module that will be built using the ACCI EAF MVP
- **so that** we have a focused target for validating the EAF's capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. A brief Project Brief or scope document for the selected pilot service/module is created and approved by stakeholders. This brief will be located at `docs/pilots/ticket-management-brief.md`.
2. The pilot service scope demonstrably exercises key EAF MVP features: involves at least one event-sourced Aggregate, a few Commands and Events, a simple Projector updating a read model, basic UI interaction (if applicable, using the UI Foundation Kit), and integration with the EAF IAM service for security.
3. Success criteria for the pilot, specifically from an EAF validation perspective (e.g., "Developer was able to implement X feature using EAF SDK Y within Z timeframe," "TDD practices were successfully followed," "Hexagonal structure maintained"), are documented within the Project Brief.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story is a planning and documentation exercise, not a coding one. The main deliverable is a **Project Brief** for the pilot service. We have selected a **"Simple Ticket Management System"** as the pilot project. This system is ideal because it's simple to understand yet complex enough to touch all major EAF features.

The goal is to produce a clear and concise document that will guide the development of the pilot in subsequent stories (2.8.2, 2.8.3).

### Project Brief Structure

The new file `docs/pilots/ticket-management-brief.md` should be created and structured with the following sections:

1. **Project Name**: Simple Ticket Management System
2. **Problem Statement**: Briefly describe the user need (e.g., "A simple way for support staff to track customer issues.").
3. **Core Features (MVP Scope)**:
    - **Ticket Creation**: A user can create a new support ticket with a title and description.
    - **Ticket Assignment**: A user can assign a ticket to another user.
    - **Ticket Closure**: A user can close a ticket.
    - **Ticket View**: A user can view a list of open tickets and their details.
4. **EAF Feature Validation**: This section explicitly maps the pilot's features to the EAF capabilities we need to validate (fulfills AC2).
    - **Event Sourcing/CQRS**:
        - **Aggregate**: `Ticket`
        - **Commands**: `CreateTicket`, `AssignTicket`, `CloseTicket`
        - **Events**: `TicketCreated`, `TicketAssigned`, `TicketClosed`
    - **Projections**:
        - A `TicketSummaryProjector` will listen to events and update a `ticket_summary` read model table.
    - **IAM Integration**:
        - All actions require an authenticated user.
        - The user who creates the ticket is recorded.
    - **UI Foundation Kit**:
        - A simple UI will be built using components from the kit to create and view tickets.
    - **ACCI EAF CLI**:
        - The service will be initially scaffolded using `eaf generate service`.
5. **Success Criteria (EAF Validation)**: This section outlines how we will measure the success of the EAF itself through this pilot (fulfills AC3).
    - **Developer Experience**:
        - Time from `eaf generate service` to a running "hello world" endpoint is under 15 minutes.
        - A developer can implement the `CreateTicket` command, event, and state change within the aggregate in under 1 hour using the `eaf-eventsourcing-sdk`.
    - **Architectural Adherence**:
        - The pilot service maintains 100% compliance with ArchUnit tests for Hexagonal Architecture.
        - TDD practices are followed, with >90% test coverage for new domain and application logic.
    - **SDK Usability**:
        - The `eaf-eventing-sdk` is used to correctly publish all domain events.
        - The `eaf-iam-client` is used to secure all endpoints.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Create the Project Brief Document** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create the new file `docs/pilots/ticket-management-brief.md`.
- [ ] **Task 2: Define Scope and Features** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Write the "Problem Statement" and "Core Features" sections in the brief.
  - [ ] Complete the "EAF Feature Validation" section, detailing the aggregate, commands, events, and other EAF components that will be used.
- [ ] **Task 3: Document Success Criteria** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Complete the "Success Criteria (EAF Validation)" section in the brief with measurable goals.
- [ ] **Task 4: Review and Finalize**
  - [ ] Review the completed brief to ensure it meets all acceptance criteria.
  - [ ] Mark this story as "Done" once the brief is finalized. The "approval" is implicit by completing this task.

## Notes

- This story does not require any code changes to the application itself. All work is confined to the `/docs` directory.
- The output of this story is the input for Story 2.8.2 (Develop Pilot Service/Module).
