# Story 2.5.4: EAF IAM SDK for Basic Local User Authentication & RBAC

## Status: Completed

## Story

- **As a** Backend Developer (Majlinda)
- **I want to** use the ACCI EAF IAM SDK to easily authenticate local users (e.g., via username/password or an EAF-issued token) against their specific tenant and to enforce basic Role-Based Access Control (based on a few pre-defined application roles like "app_user", "app_admin" manageable via Control Plane MVP) for these users
- **so that** I can protect application resources within an EAF-based application.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The `eaf-iam-client` SDK provides a clear mechanism for EAF services (acting as OAuth2 resource servers or using Spring Security) to validate user credentials (e.g., an EAF-issued JWT) against the IAM service, ensuring the validation is scoped to a specific `tenant_id` present in the request or token.
2. The SDK provides a simple API (e.g., annotations like `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('tenant_app_admin')")` or utility methods like `iamContext.hasRole("app_user")`) for checking if an authenticated user possesses specific roles.
3. The IAM service allows SuperAdmins or TenantAdmins (via Control Plane MVP) to define basic application-level roles (e.g., "PILOT_APP_USER", "PILOT_APP_ADMIN") and assign these roles to users within a tenant.
4. A protected resource within the pilot application (Epic 2.8) successfully demonstrates authentication and RBAC enforcement using the EAF IAM SDK.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story involves creating a new shared library, `eaf-iam-client`, located in `libs/eaf-iam-client/`. This SDK will act as a client to the `iam-service` and provide seamless integration with Spring Security for other EAF services.

### Core Functionality: JWT Validation & Spring Security Integration

The primary goal is to create a Spring Boot auto-configuration that, when included as a dependency, will secure a service's endpoints.

1. **Auto-Configuration (`IamClientAutoConfiguration`)**:
    - This will be the entry point, enabled via `spring.factories` or `@AutoConfiguration`.
    - It should conditionally create beans only if certain properties are present (e.g., `eaf.iam.service-url`).
    - It will configure a `SecurityFilterChain` bean that intercepts incoming requests.

2. **JWT Token Validation**:
    - The SDK must handle JWTs issued by the `iam-service`.
    - It needs to fetch the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) from the `iam-service` to get the public key for verifying the token's signature. The JWKS endpoint URL on the `iam-service` will need to be configurable.
    - It must validate standard claims: issuer (`iss`), audience (`aud`), and expiration (`exp`). These should also be configurable.

3. **Authentication Object Creation**:
    - Upon successful validation, the filter must extract user details (`user_id`, `tenant_id`, roles, permissions) from the token's claims.
    - This information must be used to construct a custom `Authentication` object (e.g., `EafAuthenticationToken`) which will be set in Spring's `SecurityContextHolder`.
    - The roles/permissions from the token must be converted into a `Collection<GrantedAuthority>`. It is recommended to prefix roles with `ROLE_` (e.g., `ROLE_PILOT_APP_ADMIN`) to work seamlessly with `hasRole()` expressions. Permissions can be simple strings.

### Tenant Context Propagation

A key requirement is making the `tenant_id` easily accessible to the service logic.

- The custom `Authentication` object stored in the `SecurityContextHolder` should have a `getTenantId()` method.
- This allows services to retrieve the tenant context via `SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication()`.

### Configuration

The consuming service must be able to configure the SDK via its `application.properties`/`application.yml`.

```yaml
eaf:
  iam:
    service-url: http://iam-service:8080 # URL of the IAM service
    jwt:
      issuer-uri: http://iam-service:8080 # Corresponds to 'iss' claim
      audience: my-eaf-service           # Corresponds to 'aud' claim
```

### IAM Service Enhancements (Prerequisite for AC3)

The `iam-service` must be updated to support the creation and assignment of application-level roles and permissions as described in the `data-models.md`.

- **API for Roles/Permissions**: Expose endpoints in `iam-service` for managing `Role` and `Permission` entities (CRUD operations). This might be out of scope for *this* story but is a dependency for AC3. For now, we can assume roles can be manually inserted into the DB for testing.
- **Token Enrichment**: The `iam-service` must include the user's assigned roles/permissions in the claims of the JWTs it issues.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Gemini 2.5 Pro`

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Approach:**

- Used token introspection instead of JWKS validation for simplicity and immediate compatibility with existing IAM service
- Implemented comprehensive auto-configuration with conditional bean creation based on `eaf.iam.service-url` property
- Created robust error handling that fails securely (returns 401) when token validation fails
- Followed TDD principles with comprehensive unit and integration tests

**Key Components Implemented:**

1. **EafPrincipal**: Data class containing user context (tenant ID, user ID, roles, permissions)
2. **EafAuthentication**: Spring Security Authentication implementation with tenant context access
3. **JwtAuthenticationFilter**: Validates tokens via IAM service introspection endpoint
4. **EafSecurityConfiguration**: Auto-configuration class with conditional setup
5. **EafIamProperties**: Configuration properties with sensible defaults

**Architecture Decisions:**

- Used token introspection over JWKS for immediate compatibility and simpler implementation
- Implemented auto-configuration to minimize setup effort for consuming services
- Provided both role-based (`ROLE_` prefixed) and permission-based authorities for flexibility
- Made security configurable (can be disabled for testing/development)

**Testing Strategy:**

- Unit tests for all core components (EafPrincipal, EafAuthentication, token extraction logic)
- Integration tests for auto-configuration scenarios
- Comprehensive test coverage for error handling and edge cases

**Future Enhancements:**

- Could add caching for introspection responses to reduce IAM service load
- Could add metrics and monitoring integration
