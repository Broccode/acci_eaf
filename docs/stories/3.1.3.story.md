# Story 3.1.3: Implement Workaround for Hilla KotlinNullabilityPlugin Issue

## Status: Draft

## Story

- **As a** Backend Developer (Majlinda)
- **I need** to implement a temporary workaround for the Hilla KotlinNullabilityPlugin crash when processing Kotlin collections with mismatched @JsonProperty names
- **so that** I can continue developing Hilla endpoints without being blocked by the upstream bug and maintain project momentum.

## Problem Statement

A comprehensive root cause analysis reveals that a critical `java.lang.ClassCastException` is occurring within the Hilla framework (v24.8.0.alpha5) during the OpenAPI generation phase. This is not a simple bug but a symptom of a significant architectural fissure within the Hilla parser's plugin-based processing pipeline.

The failure, tracked in [GitHub issue #3443](https://github.com/vaadin/hilla/issues/3443), is deterministically triggered by a "perfect storm" of three conditions:

1. **A generic Kotlin collection property** (e.g., `Set<String>`).
2. **An aliased Jackson `@JsonProperty`** where the value differs from the property's name (e.g., `@JsonProperty("email_addresses") val emailAddresses`).
3. **The execution of the downstream `KotlinNullabilityPlugin`**.

The root cause is a broken contract between the upstream plugin component responsible for processing Jackson annotations and the downstream `KotlinNullabilityPlugin`. The act of aliasing the generic collection property results in the creation of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with a structural variant—a `CompositeTypeSignatureNode`—that the `KotlinNullabilityPlugin` is not equipped to handle. The plugin's logic makes a faulty assumption that it will always receive a simpler `TypeSignatureNode` in this specific code path, leading to the direct and failing cast.

**Error Details:**

```
Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: class com.vaadin.hilla.parser.plugins.backbone.nodes.CompositeTypeSignatureNode cannot be cast to class com.vaadin.hilla.parser.plugins.backbone.nodes.TypeSignatureNode
 at com.vaadin.hilla.parser.plugins.nonnull.kotlin.KotlinNullabilityPlugin.resolveTypedNode(KotlinNullabilityPlugin.kt:135)
```

This story aims to implement a robust workaround to bypass this flawed logic path, allowing development to proceed without being blocked by the upstream bug.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **Temporary Solution Documentation**: Document the chosen workaround approach with clear guidance on when and how to apply it.
2. **Affected Endpoints Refactored**: All currently affected endpoints are refactored to use the workaround pattern.
3. **Development Guidelines Updated**: Update operational guidelines with a "Known Issues" section documenting this limitation and the standard workaround.
4. **Tracking Mechanism**: Implement a way to track all places where the workaround is applied for easy reversal when the fix is available.
5. **Integration Tests**: Ensure all refactored endpoints maintain their original functionality through comprehensive integration tests.
6. **Migration Plan**: Create a documented plan for reverting the workaround once Hilla releases a fix.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Root Cause Summary

The `ClassCastException` is a direct result of a broken implicit contract between two Hilla parser plugins. Here's the sequence of failure:

1. **AST Generation:** The parser correctly creates a `CompositeTypeSignatureNode` to represent a generic type like `Set<String>`.
2. **Jackson Plugin Execution:** The plugin that processes `@JsonProperty` modifies the AST to handle the name alias. In doing so, it creates a structural anomaly for this specific combination of aliasing and generics.
3. **KotlinNullabilityPlugin Crash:** The downstream `KotlinNullabilityPlugin` receives this anomalous AST structure. Its internal logic was not designed for this variant and it makes an unsafe cast from `CompositeTypeSignatureNode` to `TypeSignatureNode`, causing the crash.

Our workaround strategy is designed to avoid triggering this specific, flawed AST generation path altogether by providing Hilla with a "clean" DTO that does not involve property aliasing.

### Workaround Options

We have several workaround approaches available:

1. **Match JsonProperty to Field Names** (Limited Applicability)
   - Change `@field:JsonProperty("email_addresses")` to `@field:JsonProperty("emailAddresses")`
   - Only works if we control the API contract

2. **Use Simple Types Instead of Collections** (Temporary)
   - Replace `Set<String>` with `String` containing comma-separated values
   - Requires additional parsing logic

3. **Disable Affected Endpoints** (Current Approach)
   - Comment out `@BrowserCallable` annotations
   - Maintains code structure for easy re-enabling

4. **Create DTO Wrapper Classes** (Recommended)
   - Create intermediate DTOs without @JsonProperty for Hilla
   - Map between external DTOs and Hilla DTOs in the service layer

### Recommended Implementation Pattern

```kotlin
// External DTO (for backend services)
data class ExternalUserDto(
    @field:JsonProperty("email_addresses") 
    val emailAddresses: Set<String>
)

// Hilla DTO (for frontend communication)
data class HillaUserDto(
    val emailAddresses: Set<String>  // No @JsonProperty
)

// Mapping in service layer
@BrowserCallable
class UserEndpoint(private val userService: UserService) {
    
    fun getUser(id: String): HillaUserDto {
        val externalUser = userService.getExternalUser(id)
        return externalUser.toHillaDto()
    }
}

// Extension function for mapping
fun ExternalUserDto.toHillaDto() = HillaUserDto(
    emailAddresses = this.emailAddresses
)
```

### Tracking Workarounds

Add a marker annotation to track all workaround locations:

```kotlin
@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS, AnnotationTarget.FUNCTION)
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.SOURCE)
@MustBeDocumented
annotation class HillaWorkaround(
    val issue: String = "https://github.com/vaadin/hilla/issues/3443",
    val description: String = ""
)
```

## Implementation Notes

### Affected Services

- Control Plane Service
- IAM Service (if using Hilla endpoints)
- Any future services with external API integrations

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for DTO mapping functions
- Integration tests to verify endpoint functionality
- Contract tests to ensure external API compatibility

### Risk Mitigation

- Keep workaround code clearly separated and marked
- Maintain original DTOs for easy reversal
- Regular checks on Hilla issue status

## Dependencies

- **External**: [Hilla Issue #3443](https://github.com/vaadin/hilla/issues/3443) resolution
- **Internal**: None - This is an independent workaround task
