# Story 4.1.4: Unit & Integration Testing for EventStorageEngine

## Status: Completed

## Story

- **As a** Developer
- **I want** to write comprehensive unit and integration tests for the `EafPostgresEventStorageEngine`
- **so that** I can verify its correctness, concurrency handling, and tenant isolation with the **Axon Framework 4.11.2** implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Unit tests are created for `EafPostgresEventStorageEngine` using MockK to mock the `EafEventStoreSdk`.
2. Unit tests cover all public methods and verify correct mapping and exception translation logic.
3. Integration tests are created using Testcontainers to spin up a real PostgreSQL instance.
4. Integration tests verify the end-to-end event persistence and retrieval flow with **Axon 4.11.2**.
5. Integration tests include specific scenarios for optimistic concurrency conflicts and tenant data isolation.
6. **NEW**: Tests validate enhanced components from 4.1.2 & 4.1.3 (GlobalSequenceTrackingToken factory methods, TenantContextHolder coroutine support).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Unit Test Infrastructure Setup** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `EafPostgresEventStorageEngineTest.kt` in `libs/eaf-eventsourcing-sdk/src/test/kotlin/com/axians/eaf/eventsourcing/axon/`
  - [x] Set up MockK for `EafEventStoreSdk`, `TenantContextHolder`, and `AxonEventMessageMapper`
  - [x] **CRITICAL**: Use specific imports (`import io.mockk.mockk`, `import io.mockk.coEvery`) - NO wildcard imports
  - [x] Create test fixtures for `DomainEventMessage`, `StoredEvent`, and `GlobalSequenceTrackingToken` instances
  - [x] Set up test data builders for consistent test event creation
  - [x] Configure `mockk<Type>(relaxed = true)` to avoid MockK DSL matcher issues

- [x] **Task 2: Core Method Unit Testing** (AC: 2)
  - [x] Test `appendEvents()` method with various event types and metadata
  - [x] Test `storeSnapshot()` with aggregate snapshots and proper delegation
  - [x] Test `readEvents(identifier, firstSequenceNumber)` for aggregate loading scenarios
  - [x] Test `readEvents(trackingToken, mayBlock)` for event streaming scenarios
  - [x] Test `createTailToken()` and `createHeadToken()` token creation methods
  - [x] Verify all method calls delegate correctly to `EafEventStoreSdk` with expected parameters

- [x] **Task 3: Enhanced GlobalSequenceTrackingToken Testing** (AC: 6)
  - [x] Test `GlobalSequenceTrackingToken.initial()` factory method
  - [x] Test `GlobalSequenceTrackingToken.of(globalSequence)` factory method
  - [x] Test `GlobalSequenceTrackingToken.head(maxSequence)` factory method
  - [x] Test `advance()` and `advanceTo(sequenceId)` utility methods
  - [x] Test `covers()` and `upperBound()` methods with various sequence scenarios
  - [x] Verify serialization compatibility with Axon 4.11.2 TokenStore

- [x] **Task 4: Enhanced TenantContextHolder Testing** (AC: 6)
  - [x] Test `executeInTenantContext(tenantId, block)` scoped execution
  - [x] Test coroutine support with `CoroutineContext.Element` integration
  - [x] Test context inheritance for child threads/coroutines
  - [x] Test `requireCurrentTenantId()` exception scenarios
  - [x] Test thread safety with concurrent tenant context operations
  - [x] Test tenant context validation and sanitization methods

- [x] **Task 5: Event Message Translation Testing**
  - [x] Test bidirectional conversion: `DomainEventMessage â†” StoredEvent`
  - [x] Verify metadata preservation (correlation data, timestamps, aggregate version)
  - [x] Test serialization/deserialization of various event payload types with **Axon 4.11.2**
  - [x] Test snapshot event vs domain event handling differences
  - [x] Verify error scenarios in event translation (malformed JSON, missing fields)

- [x] **Task 6: Exception Handling Unit Tests**
  - [x] Test `OptimisticLockException` translation to `ConcurrencyException`
  - [x] Test `SQLException`
