# Story 4.3.1: Refactor User Entity to Axon User Aggregate

## Status: To Do

## Story
- **As a** Developer
- **I want** to convert the existing `User` JPA entity into a pure, event-sourced Axon Aggregate
- **so that** its state changes are captured as a sequence of domain events.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new `User` class is created in the `domain/model` package that will serve as the aggregate root.
2. The class has a field annotated with `@AggregateIdentifier`.
3. The existing fields from the `User` JPA entity are represented as state in the new aggregate class.
4. The JPA annotations are removed, and the class is a pure domain object.
5. The old `User` JPA entity is marked as deprecated or removed.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Analyze Current User JPA Entity** (AC: 3, 5)
  - [ ] Review existing `User` entity in `apps/acci-eaf-control-plane/src/main/kotlin/com/axians/eaf/controlplane/domain/`
  - [ ] Document all current fields, relationships, and business logic
  - [ ] Identify database-specific annotations and dependencies to remove
  - [ ] Map existing validation logic to domain-level business rules
  - [ ] Create data migration strategy for existing user data

- [ ] **Task 2: Create Pure Domain User Aggregate** (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Create new `User.kt` in `apps/acci-eaf-control-plane/src/main/kotlin/com/axians/eaf/controlplane/domain/model/`
  - [ ] Remove all JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Column`, etc.)
  - [ ] Remove Spring Data and Hibernate dependencies
  - [ ] Implement as pure Kotlin data class with immutable state
  - [ ] Focus on domain behavior rather than persistence concerns

- [ ] **Task 3: Implement Aggregate Identifier Strategy** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add `@AggregateIdentifier` annotation to user ID field
  - [ ] Choose appropriate ID type (UUID recommended for distributed systems)
  - [ ] Implement ID generation strategy if needed
  - [ ] Ensure ID immutability and uniqueness
  - [ ] Add ID validation logic in domain layer

- [ ] **Task 4: Domain State Management**
  - [ ] Define aggregate state fields (username, email, roles, status, etc.)
  - [ ] Implement immutable state modification patterns
  - [ ] Add domain validation rules for each state field
  - [ ] Create value objects for complex domain concepts (UserRole, Email, etc.)
  - [ ] Implement state consistency validation methods

- [ ] **Task 5: Business Logic and Domain Rules**
  - [ ] Implement domain-specific validation logic
  - [ ] Add business rule enforcement methods
  - [ ] Create domain exception types for business rule violations
  - [ ] Implement aggregate invariant checks
  - [ ] Add domain-specific behavior methods

- [ ] **Task 6: Aggregate Root Patterns**
  - [ ] Implement proper aggregate boundary definition
  - [ ] Add methods for managing aggregate lifecycle
  - [ ] Implement domain event tracking and clearing
  - [ ] Add aggregate versioning support if needed
  - [ ] Ensure single responsibility for aggregate operations

- [ ] **Task 7: Migration and Deprecation Strategy** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Mark existing `User` JPA entity as `@Deprecated`
  - [ ] Create user data migration utilities
  - [ ] Plan gradual migration from JPA to event-sourced model
  - [ ] Update repository interfaces to work with aggregate
  - [ ] Create adapter patterns for backward compatibility during transition

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Module Location**: `apps/acci-eaf-control-plane/src/main/kotlin/com/axians/eaf/controlplane/domain/model/`
- **Dependencies Required**: Remove JPA dependencies and add Axon:
  ```kotlin
  // Remove these from dependencies:
  // implementation(libs.spring.boot.starter.data.jpa)
  // implementation(libs.hibernate.validator)
  
  // Add these:
  implementation(libs.axon.modelling)
  implementation(libs.axon.eventsourcing)
  ```
- **Aggregate Design Principles**:
  - Keep aggregates small and focused on single business concept
  - Enforce business invariants within aggregate boundary
  - Use immutable state and event-driven state changes
  - Avoid external dependencies and infrastructure concerns
- **Hexagonal Architecture Compliance**:
  - Place in `domain/model` package (core domain)
  - No infrastructure dependencies (database, web, etc.)
  - Pure domain logic with no framework coupling
  - Use domain exceptions rather than technical exceptions
- **ID Strategy**: 
  ```kotlin
  data class User(
      @AggregateIdentifier
      val id: UUID,
      // other fields...
  )
  ```
- **Value Objects**: Create value objects for complex domain concepts:
  ```kotlin
  data class Email(val value: String) {
      init {
          require(value.matches(EMAIL_REGEX)) { "Invalid email format" }
      }
  }
  ```
- **Domain Validation**: Implement validation at domain level, not annotation-based
- **State Immutability**: Use copy operations for state changes rather than mutable properties

## Testing Guidance

- **Objective**: Verify the aggregate maintains business logic integrity while removing infrastructure dependencies
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  - **Domain Logic Tests**:
    - Test business rule validation and enforcement
    - Verify domain exception throwing for invalid operations
    - Test aggregate state consistency maintenance
    - Validate business invariant preservation
  - **Aggregate Behavior Tests**:
    - Test aggregate creation with valid and invalid data
    - Verify state modification methods work correctly
    - Test aggregate lifecycle management
    - Validate domain event generation (preparation for next story)
  - **Value Object Tests**:
    - Test value object validation and immutability
    - Verify value object equality and hashing
    - Test serialization/deserialization if needed
    - Validate value object business rules
  - **Migration Compatibility Tests**:
    - Test data migration from JPA entity to aggregate
    - Verify backward compatibility during transition
    - Test adapter patterns for legacy code integration
    - Validate data integrity during migration
  - **Performance Tests**:
    - Compare memory usage vs JPA entity
    - Test aggregate creation and modification performance
    - Validate garbage collection behavior
    - Test with large numbers of aggregate instances
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - All existing business logic preserved and testable
  - No infrastructure dependencies in domain model
  - Complete test coverage for domain rules and validation
  - Successful data migration from existing JPA entities
  - Performance comparable or better than JPA entity
- **Domain Purity Validation**:
  - No database annotations in domain model
  - No Spring framework dependencies in domain layer
  - No technical exceptions, only domain exceptions
  - All business rules testable without infrastructure
- **Business Logic Verification**:
  - All user validation rules preserved
  - User lifecycle operations work correctly
  - Domain consistency maintained across operations
  - Business exceptions provide clear domain context
- **Tools**: JUnit 5, AssertJ, Kotlin test utilities, domain-specific test builders, property-based testing with Kotest
