# Story 2.4.3: SDK Support for Idempotent Projectors

## Status: Review

## Story

- **As a** Backend Developer (Majlinda)
- **I want** the ACCI EAF Kotlin/Spring SDK to offer straightforward patterns and helper utilities for building idempotent Projectors that consume domain events from NATS (via the EAF Eventing SDK) and reliably update read models (e.g., in PostgreSQL)
- **so I can** efficiently create queryable views of data.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The `eaf-eventing-sdk` or `eaf-eventsourcing-sdk` provides clear patterns or abstractions (e.g., base classes, annotations like `@EafProjectorEventHandler`) for creating Projector components as Spring beans that listen to specific domain events.
2. Projectors MUST consume events via the EAF Eventing SDK and rigorously handle potential event redeliveries to ensure idempotency in read model updates (e.g., by checking if an event ID has already been processed or by using UPSERT database operations on the read model, potentially with a `processed_event_id` tracking mechanism).
3. Projectors, when updating read models (e.g., in PostgreSQL), MUST strictly enforce tenant data isolation (e.g., by incorporating `tenant_id` in all read model queries and updates, derived from event metadata).
4. "The Launchpad" provides documented examples of building Projectors, including strategies for managing read model schemas, handling errors during projection, and dealing with eventual consistency.

## Implementation Notes

### Current Implementation Status

**Completed:**

- ✅ Database migration for `processed_events` table
- ✅ `@EafProjectorEventHandler` annotation with comprehensive configuration options
- ✅ `ProcessedEventRepository` interface and `JdbcProcessedEventRepository` implementation with strict tenant isolation
- ✅ Spring `BeanPostProcessor` that discovers annotated methods and registers them
- ✅ `IdempotentProjectorService` that provides transactional idempotency logic
- ✅ Example projector demonstrating usage
- ✅ Documentation in "The Launchpad"
- ✅ Unit tests for repository functionality

**Integration Approach:**
The current implementation provides the core abstractions and services needed for idempotent projectors. The `@EafProjectorEventHandler` annotation is processed by a Spring `BeanPostProcessor` that registers projector definitions. The `IdempotentProjectorService` provides the transactional idempotency logic that can be integrated with the existing NATS infrastructure.

**Next Steps:**
To complete the full integration, developers can use the `IdempotentProjectorService` from within manually created `@NatsJetStreamListener` methods, or the EAF team can extend the current implementation to automatically create NATS listeners for discovered projectors.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Projector Component Location

- Per Hexagonal Architecture principles, Projectors are inbound adapters. They should be located in the `infrastructure/adapter/in/messaging` package within a service.

### Idempotency Strategy: Processed Event Tracking

- The primary strategy for ensuring idempotency will be to track processed event IDs. A dedicated database table should be used for this.
- **Proposed Schema for `processed_events` table:**

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE processed_events (
      projector_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      event_id UUID NOT NULL,
      tenant_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      processed_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT (now() AT TIME ZONE 'utc'),
      PRIMARY KEY (projector_name, event_id, tenant_id)
  );
  ```

- The `projector_name` allows multiple independent projectors to process the same event.
- The entire update operation within a projector (i.e., inserting into `processed_events` and updating the read model) MUST be executed within a single database transaction to ensure atomicity.

### SDK Abstractions (`@EafProjectorEventHandler`)

- A new annotation, `@EafProjectorEventHandler`, should be created within the `eaf-eventing-sdk`.
- This annotation will wrap the functionality of the underlying NATS listener (`@NatsJetStreamListener`) and provide a higher-level abstraction for developers.
- It should automatically handle:
  - Deserializing the event payload.
  - Extracting `eventId` and `tenantId` from the message.
  - Implementing the transaction management and idempotency check using the `processed_events` table.
- **Example Usage:**

  ```kotlin
  @Component
  class UserProjector(private val readModelRepository: UserReadModelRepository) {

      @EafProjectorEventHandler(projectorName = "user-projector")
      fun handleUserCreatedEvent(event: UserCreatedEvent, eventId: UUID, tenantId: String) {
          // This block is only executed if the eventId has not been processed
          // and is inside a transaction.
          val readModel = UserReadModel(id = event.userId, email = event.email, tenantId = tenantId)
          readModelRepository.save(readModel)
      }
  }
  ```

### Tenant Data Isolation

- The SDK abstraction MUST enforce tenant isolation. The `tenantId` extracted from the event message metadata must be used in all database operations, both for checking the `processed_events` table and for updating the target read model.

### Error Handling

- As per `operational-guidelines.md`, if the projector's logic fails (e.g., a database constraint violation), the entire transaction must be rolled back.
- The SDK should `nak()` the message to allow for redelivery and retries, according to the NATS consumer's configuration.
- For "poison pill" messages that repeatedly fail, a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) strategy should be employed, which is a consumer-level configuration in JetStream. The SDK should log these failures clearly.

## Tasks / Subtasks

    - [x] Start a new database transaction.
    - [x] Extract `eventId` and `tenantId` from the event message.
    - [x] Check if the event has already been processed by querying the `processed_events` table (using `projector_name`, `eventId`, `tenantId`).
    - [x] If not processed, invoke the annotated projector method.
