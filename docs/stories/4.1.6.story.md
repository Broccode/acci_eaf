# Story 4.1.6: Performance Test Schema

## Status: Completed

## Story

- **As a** Developer
- **I want** to seed the event store with 1M+ test events and run performance tests against the new schema
- **so that** I can ensure query performance meets our latency targets under load.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ A script or test utility is created to populate the `domain_events` table with at least 1 million realistic test events across multiple tenants and aggregates.
2. ✅ Performance tests are created to measure the query latency for common `EafPostgresEventStorageEngine` operations (e.g., reading event streams for a `TrackingEventProcessor`).
3. ✅ The tests verify that query performance for streaming events remains within the defined SLA (e.g., <50ms per batch).
4. ✅ The database query plans (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) are reviewed to confirm that the correct indexes are being used.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Test Location**: `libs/eaf-eventsourcing-sdk/src/test/kotlin/com/axians/eaf/eventsourcing/performance/`
- **Dependencies Required**: Add to `libs/eaf-eventsourcing-sdk/build.gradle.kts`:

  ```kotlin
  testImplementation(libs.jmh.core)
  testImplementation(libs.jmh.generator.annprocess)
  testImplementation(libs.testcontainers.postgresql)
  testImplementation(libs.hikaricp)
  testImplementation(libs.kotlinx.coroutines.test)
  ```

- **Performance Targets**:
  - Event append: <10ms for single event, <50ms for 100-event batch
  - Aggregate loading: <20ms for 1000-event aggregate
  - Event streaming: <50ms for 1000-event batch
  - Token operations: <1ms for all token creation/comparison operations
- **Test Data Characteristics**:
  - 10+ tenants with realistic distribution (80/20 rule)
  - 1000+ aggregates per tenant with realistic lifecycle patterns
  - Event payload sizes: 70% small (100-500B), 25% medium (1-5KB), 5% large (5-10KB)
  - Temporal distribution: realistic business hour patterns over months
- **Database Configuration**: Use production-like settings:
  - Connection pool: 20-50 connections
  - PostgreSQL: Properly tuned for write-heavy workloads
  - Memory: adequate shared_buffers and work_mem settings
- **Measurement Strategy**:
  - Use JMH for microsecond-level precision
  - Include warm-up iterations to avoid JIT compilation bias
  - Measure 95th percentile latencies, not just averages
  - Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) during tests

## Testing Guidance

- **Objective**: Validate that the enhanced schema performs at production scale with realistic loads
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  - **Baseline Performance Tests**:
    - Single-threaded operation benchmarks
    - Memory usage patterns during large operations
    - Database resource utilization measurement
    - Query execution plan analysis

    - Multiple TrackingEventProcessors consuming events simultaneously
    - Concurrent aggregate loading and event appending
    - Mixed read/write workloads simulating production usage
    - Database lock contention and deadlock detection
  - **Scale Tests**:
    - Performance degradation analysis as dataset grows (1M → 10M → 100M events)
    - Index effectiveness at different data volumes
    - Memory requirements for large query result sets
    - Garbage collection behavior under sustained load
  - **Tenant Isolation Performance**:
    - Verify no tenant queries affect other tenant performance
    - Test tenant-specific index effectiveness
    - Measure overhead of tenant filtering in all queries
