# Story 4.6.3: Implement Chaos Engineering Tests

## Status: To Do

## Story
- **As a** Reliability Engineer
- **I want** to implement chaos engineering tests to validate the system's resilience
- **so that** I can ensure it gracefully handles various failure scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Chaos engineering test scenarios are created for key failure modes (e.g., database outages, NATS failures, high CPU load).
2. Tests verify that the system can recover automatically from temporary outages.
3. Tests confirm that event processing resumes correctly after failures without data loss.
4. The system's behavior during failures is documented, including expected recovery times.
5. Monitoring and alerting systems correctly detect and report failures during chaos tests.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Test Location**: `apps/acci-eaf-control-plane/src/test/chaos/`
- **Dependencies Required**: Add to build.gradle.kts:
  ```kotlin
  testImplementation(libs.chaos.monkey.spring.boot)
  testImplementation(libs.testcontainers.toxiproxy)
  testImplementation(libs.wiremock)
  testImplementation(libs.awaitility)
  ```
- **Chaos Monkey Configuration**:
  ```yaml
  chaos:
    monkey:
      enabled: true
      watcher:
        component: true
        controller: true
        repository: true
        service: true
      assaults:
        latency:
          level: 3
          latency-range-start: 100
          latency-range-end: 5000
        exception:
          level: 2
        app-killer:
          level: 1
        memory:
          level: 1
  ```
- **Database Chaos Test Example**:
  ```kotlin
  @Test
  fun `should recover from database connection failure`() {
      // Start with healthy system
      assertSystemIsHealthy()
      
      // Inject database failure
      toxiproxy.disable("postgresql")
      
      // Verify system detects failure and triggers alerts
      await().atMost(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
          .until { alertManager.hasAlert("DatabaseConnectionFailure") }
      
      // Restore database connection
      toxiproxy.enable("postgresql")
      
      // Verify system recovers automatically
      await().atMost(Duration.ofMinutes(2))
          .until { systemHealthCheck.isHealthy() }
      
      // Verify no data loss
      verifyEventStoreIntegrity()
      verifyEventProcessingResumes()
  }
  ```
- **NATS Chaos Test Framework**:
  ```kotlin
  @Component
  class NatsChaosTest {
      fun simulateNatsFailure() {
          // Stop NATS container
          natsContainer.stop()
          
          // Verify circuit breaker activates
          verifyCircuitBreakerOpen("nats-publisher")
          
          // Restart NATS
          natsContainer.start()
          
          // Verify recovery and event publishing resumes
          verifyEventPublishingRecovery()
      }
  }
  ```
- **Resilience Testing Patterns**:
  - **Circuit Breaker Testing**: Verify circuit breakers activate during failures
  - **Retry Logic Validation**: Test exponential backoff and retry limits
  - **Graceful Degradation**: Verify system continues operating with reduced functionality
  - **Data Consistency**: Ensure no data corruption during failures
- **Test Safety Measures**:
  - Use isolated test environments
  - Implement automatic test termination on critical failures
  - Have rollback procedures for all chaos scenarios
  - Monitor test impact and abort if excessive

## Testing Guidance

- **Objective**: Validate system resilience and recovery capabilities under various failure conditions
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  - **Database Failure Scenarios**:
    - Primary database unavailable (connection timeout)
    - Slow database queries (latency injection)
    - Connection pool exhaustion
    - Database deadlocks and transaction failures
    - Storage full scenarios
  - **Messaging System Failures**:
    - NATS server completely unavailable
    - NATS network partitions and split-brain
    - Message delivery delays and timeouts
    - Subject permission failures
    - Message size limit violations
  - **Application Resource Exhaustion**:
    - CPU saturation (>95% utilization)
    - Memory pressure and OutOfMemoryError
    - Thread pool exhaustion
    - File descriptor limits
    - Disk space exhaustion
  - **Network-Level Disruptions**:
    - Network latency injection (100ms-5s)
    - Packet loss simulation (1%-10%)
    - Network partitions and isolation
    - DNS resolution failures
    - SSL/TLS certificate issues
  - **Event Processing Resilience**:
    - Tracking event processor failures and recovery
    - Token store corruption and recovery
    - Event replay after long outages
    - Projection lag under stress
    - Dead letter queue processing
- **Chaos Test Implementation**:
  ```kotlin
  @ChaoticTest
  class SystemResilienceTest {
      
      @Test
      @ChaosAssault(type = LATENCY, target = "postgresql", duration = "5m")
      fun `should handle database latency gracefully`() {
          // System should continue operating with slower responses
          // Circuit breakers should not trip for latency alone
          // Monitoring should show increased latency but not errors
      }
      
      @Test
      @ChaosAssault(type = EXCEPTION, target = "nats-publisher", rate = 0.1)
      fun `should recover from intermittent NATS failures`() {
          // Retry logic should handle 10% failure rate
          // Events should eventually be published
          // No events should be lost
      }
  }
  ```
