# Story 2.4.1: SDK Abstractions for Event-Sourced Aggregates

## Status: Completed

## Story

- As a Backend Developer (Majlinda)
- I want to use ACCI EAF's Kotlin/Spring SDK to easily define and implement event-sourced Aggregates that seamlessly integrate with the EAF's Event Store SDK and Eventing Bus SDK
- so that I can focus on my core domain logic rather than complex CQRS/ES plumbing.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The `eaf-eventsourcing-sdk` provides base classes, interfaces, or annotations (e.g., `@EafAggregate`, `@EafCommandHandler`, `@EafEventSourcingHandler`) to simplify the definition of Aggregates in Kotlin.
2. The SDK facilitates common Aggregate operations: loading from history (events + optional snapshot) via the EAF Event Store SDK, applying new events, and having new events persisted by the EAF Event Store SDK and published via the EAF Eventing SDK (potentially using Unit of Work concepts for consistency).
3. Aggregates developed using the EAF SDK MUST adhere to Hexagonal Architecture principles, ensuring domain logic within the aggregate is isolated from direct infrastructure concerns (persistence and event publishing are handled via SDK-provided ports/mechanisms).
4. Aggregates MUST implement optimistic concurrency control using sequence numbers, with conflicts handled and surfaced by the EAF Event Store SDK interactions.
5. All state changes within aggregates MUST be derived exclusively from domain events applied via EAF SDK-provided mechanisms (e.g., methods analogous to `@EventSourcingHandler`).
6. "The Launchpad" provides clear examples and documentation for defining and testing EAF Aggregates using these SDK abstractions.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Define Core Aggregate Abstractions** (AC: 1) - COMPLETED
  - [x] Define a base `AbstractAggregateRoot` class or interface in the `eaf-eventsourcing-sdk` that manages domain events (uncommitted changes), versioning, and aggregate ID.
  - [x] Create marker annotations like `@EafAggregate`, `@EafCommandHandler`, and `@EafEventSourcingHandler` for convention-based configuration.
- [x] **Task 2: Implement Aggregate Repository/Loading Logic** (AC: 2, 4) - COMPLETED
  - [x] Create an `AggregateRepository` port and a default implementation that uses the `EventStoreRepository` (from Story 2.3.1) to load event streams.
  - [x] Implement the logic to rehydrate an aggregate instance by applying its historical events in the correct order.
  - [x] Integrate snapshot loading logic to optimize rehydration for aggregates with many events.
- [x] **Task 3: Implement Aggregate Saving and Event Publishing Logic** (AC: 2, 3) - COMPLETED
  - [x] Implement the `save` method in the `AggregateRepository`.
  - [x] This method should retrieve uncommitted events from the aggregate instance.
  - [x] It must use the `EventStoreRepository` to persist these new events atomically, respecting optimistic concurrency checks.
  - [x] After successful persistence, it must use the `NatsEventPublisher` (from Story 2.3) to publish the new events.
  - [x] Implement a Unit of Work pattern to ensure that events are only published after the database transaction commits successfully.
- [x] **Task 4: Develop an Example Aggregate** (AC: 1-5) - COMPLETED
  - [x] Within the `eaf-eventsourcing-sdk` or a new example module, create a simple but complete `SampleAggregate` (e.g., a simple `Order` or `Ticket` aggregate).
  - [x] The example should demonstrate the use of `@EafAggregate`, command handler methods, and event sourcing handler methods.
  - [x] It should contain logic that creates and applies several different types of domain events.
- [x] **Task 5: Implement Comprehensive Testing** (AC: 4, 5) - COMPLETED
  - [x] Write unit tests for the `AbstractAggregateRoot` to ensure correct event handling and version management.
  - [x] Write integration tests for the `AggregateRepository` using Testcontainers (PostgreSQL and NATS).
  - [x] Tests must validate the full lifecycle: creating an aggregate, saving it, loading it from the event store, modifying it, and saving it again.
  - [x] Tests must specifically verify that optimistic locking exceptions are thrown correctly on concurrent modification attempts.
  - [x] Tests must verify that events are published to NATS only after they are successfully persisted in the database.
- [ ] **Task 6: Document the SDK Abstractions** (AC: 6) - DEFERRED
  - [ ] Create a new documentation page in "The Launchpad" under "Architectural Principles/CQRS-ES" or a new "SDK Guides" section.
  - [ ] Document how to define an EAF aggregate using the new abstractions.
  - [ ] Provide a step-by-step guide using the `SampleAggregate` as a complete code example.
  - [ ] Explain how to test aggregates using the provided testing utilities.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Axon Framework Consideration:** The ACs mention potentially leveraging Axon Framework. This story should focus on creating the core, framework-agnostic EAF abstractions (`AbstractAggregateRoot`, etc.). These EAF abstractions can later be integrated with or adapted for Axon's lifecycle management, but the core domain object should not have a hard dependency on Axon if possible, to adhere to Hexagonal Architecture. The `AggregateRepository` is where the integration with Axon's `Repository` might happen.
- **Unit of Work:** This is a critical pattern for ensuring consistency between the event store and the event bus. A simple implementation could use Spring's `TransactionSynchronizationManager` to register a callback that publishes events `afterCommit`.
- **Hexagonal Principles:** The `AbstractAggregateRoot` and its related domain objects must reside in a `domain` package and have no dependencies on Spring, NATS, or persistence frameworks. The `AggregateRepository` implementation will act as an adapter, connecting the domain to the infrastructure (event store SDK, eventing SDK).
- **Dependencies:** This story will heavily depend on the completed **Story 2.3.1 (Event Store SDK)** and **Story 2.3 (Event Publishing SDK)**.

## Testing Guidance

- **TDD is Mandatory:** Follow the red-green-refactor cycle.
- **Aggregate Unit Tests:** Test the `SampleAggregate`'s logic in isolation. Given a command, assert that the correct domain events are produced. Given a history of events, assert that the aggregate's state is correct.
- **Repository Integration Tests:** These are crucial. They will use Testcontainers to spin up real PostgreSQL and NATS instances. The tests should cover the full `load -> modify -> save` cycle and verify both the database state and the messages published to NATS.
- **Concurrency Test:** A key test scenario is to simulate a concurrent write. Load an aggregate, then before saving it, directly use the event store to append an event for the same aggregate. The subsequent `save` call on the original instance must fail with an `OptimisticLockingFailureException`.
