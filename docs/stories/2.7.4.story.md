# Story 2.7.4: Search & Feedback Mechanism on Launchpad

## Status: Completed

## Story

- **As any** User of "The Launchpad" (Anita)
- **I want** robust search functionality covering all documentation content (guides, API refs, concept explanations) and a simple, clearly visible mechanism to provide feedback or ask questions about the documentation (e.g., a link to a dedicated feedback channel or issue tracker)
- **so that** I can efficiently find information and contribute to improving the EAF resources.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **✅ Search Enabled**: The Docusaurus search functionality is enabled, configured, and effectively indexes all portal content.
2. **✅ Feedback Link Integrated**: A clear "Feedback" or "Report Documentation Issue" link/button is present on all pages or in a consistent location (e.g., site footer or navigation bar). This link directs users to the appropriate channel (e.g., a designated GitHub Issues repository for documentation, a specific email alias, or a feedback form).

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story focuses on improving the usability and user engagement of "The Launchpad" by integrating two key features: a powerful search engine and a straightforward feedback mechanism.

### 1. Implementing Robust Search with Algolia DocSearch (AC: 1)

To provide "robust search functionality," we will use **Algolia DocSearch**, the officially supported search solution for Docusaurus. It's free for open-source projects and technical documentation.

**Step 1: Apply to the DocSearch Program**

- The first step is to apply for a free DocSearch account for the Launchpad. The website must be publicly accessible for the Algolia crawler.
- **Action**: Fill out the [DocSearch application form](https://docsearch.algolia.com/apply/).
- You will receive an `appId`, `apiKey`, and `indexName` via email once your application is approved and the first crawl is complete. This can take a few days.

**Step 2: Configure Docusaurus**

- The `@docusaurus/preset-classic` already includes the necessary Algolia search theme, so no extra package installation is needed.
- **Action**: Add the `algolia` configuration to the `themeConfig` object in `docs/docusaurus.config.js`.

```javascript
// docs/docusaurus.config.js

// ...
  themeConfig: {
    // ... other themeConfig
    algolia: {
      // The application ID provided by Algolia
      appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',

      // Public API key: it is safe to commit it
      apiKey: 'YOUR_SEARCH_API_KEY',

      indexName: 'YOUR_INDEX_NAME',

      // Optional: see official Docusaurus doc
      contextualSearch: true,

      // Optional: path for search page that enabled by default (`false` to disable it)
      searchPagePath: 'search',
    },
    navbar: {
      // ... navbar items
    },
    // ...
  },
// ...
```

- **Note**: Replace the placeholder values with the actual credentials received from Algolia. `contextualSearch` is highly recommended and enabled by default to ensure search results are relevant to the current version and language.

**Step 3: Styling (Optional)**

- The default Algolia search component style is clean and accessible.
- If custom styling is needed to match the EAF theme, you can override the default CSS variables in `src/css/custom.css`. Refer to the [official Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/search#styling-your-algolia-search) for a list of variables.

### 2. Adding a Feedback Link (AC: 2)

The goal is to provide a simple and visible way for users to give feedback. The recommended approach is linking to the project's issue tracker.

**Step 1: Determine the Feedback URL**

- A decision needs to be made on the destination for feedback. A good choice is the "Issues" tab of the GitLab or GitHub repository for the ACCI EAF project.
- **Example URL**: `https://github.com/your-org/acci-eaf-monorepo/issues/new/choose`

**Step 2: Add the Link to the Navbar**

- Adding the link to the navbar ensures it's consistently visible across the entire Launchpad site.
- **Action**: Add a new item to the `navbar.items` array in `docs/docusaurus.config.js`.

```javascript
// docs/docusaurus.config.js

// ...
  themeConfig: {
    // ...
    navbar: {
      title: 'ACCI EAF Launchpad',
      // ...
      items: [
        {
          type: 'doc',
          docId: 'intro',
          position: 'left',
          label: 'Docs',
        },
        {
          href: 'http://localhost:4400', // From Story 2.7.3
          label: 'Component Library',
          position: 'left',
        },
        // Add this new item for feedback
        {
          href: 'https://github.com/your-org/acci-eaf-monorepo/issues/new/choose', // Replace with actual URL
          label: 'Feedback',
          position: 'right',
        },
        // ... other items like GitHub link
      ],
    },
// ...
```

## Notes

**Success Metrics**:

- Users can find relevant documentation via search in under 30 seconds.
- The project receives user feedback or bug reports through the new "Feedback" link.
- A decrease in repetitive questions in other channels, as users can self-serve via search.

**Dependencies**:

- The Launchpad site must be publicly deployed and accessible for the Algolia crawler to work.
- Approval from the Algolia DocSearch program.
- A stakeholder decision on the official feedback channel URL.

**Risk Mitigation**:

- **Risk**: The Algolia DocSearch application process may be delayed.
  - **Mitigation**: The development work can proceed with placeholders. In the interim, Docusaurus's basic configuration can be prepared. There isn't a good local search fallback that meets the "robust" criteria without significant extra work, so waiting for Algolia is the best path.
- **Risk**: Search results are not accurate or complete.
  - **Mitigation**: The Algolia crawler configuration may need to be fine-tuned from the Algolia dashboard. This is a common step and their documentation provides guidance. A re-crawl can be triggered manually from their UI.
