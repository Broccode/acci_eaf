# Story 3.1.2: Fix eaf-eventing-sdk Test Failure Blocking Parallel Execution

## Status: Completed

## Story

- **As a** Developer on the EAF team
- **I need** the failing test in `eaf-eventing-sdk` to be fixed
- **so that** the `nx run-many --target=test --all` command runs successfully and provides reliable CI/CD feedback.

## Problem Statement

The `ContextPropagationIntegrationTest` in `eaf-eventing-sdk` is failing with a MockK exception, preventing the full test suite from running successfully in parallel. This blocks the completion of our parallel test execution initiative and undermines confidence in our CI/CD pipeline.

**Error Details:**

```
io.mockk.MockKException: no answer found for Message(#3).getSubject() among the configured answers: (Message(#3).getHeaders()) Message(#3).getData()))
```

The test is failing because the MockK setup for the NATS `Message` mock is incomplete - it configures `getHeaders()` and `getData()` but doesn't stub the `getSubject()` method that's being called by `DefaultMessageContext` during message processing.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The `ContextPropagationIntegrationTest.should propagate full context through NATS message flow()` test must pass consistently.
2. All MockK stubs for the `Message` mock must be properly configured to cover all method calls.
3. The test must maintain its original intent of verifying end-to-end context propagation through NATS messages.
4. The `nx run-many --target=test --all` command must complete successfully without test failures.
5. The fix must not introduce any regressions in other tests within the `eaf-eventing-sdk` module.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This is a straightforward MockK configuration fix. The test is architecturally sound but has an incomplete mock setup.

### Root Cause Analysis

The `ContextAwareMessageProcessor.processWithContext()` method calls `EafMessageContextFactory.create()`, which instantiates `DefaultMessageContext`. The `DefaultMessageContext` constructor accesses three properties of the NATS `Message`:

1. `message.headers` ✅ (already mocked)
2. `message.data` ✅ (already mocked)
3. `message.subject` ❌ (missing mock stub)

### Solution Approach

Add the missing `every { mockMessage.subject } returns "test.subject"` stub to the MockK configuration. The subject should match the subject used in the publisher call for consistency.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Add Missing Mock Stub**: Add `every { mockMessage.subject } returns "test.subject"` to the test setup.
2. **Verify Test Logic**: Ensure the mocked subject aligns with the test's intent and the subject used in the publisher call.
3. **Run Tests**: Verify the fix resolves the MockK exception and the test passes.
4. **Integration Test**: Run the full `nx run-many --target=test --all` command to confirm no regressions.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Fix MockK Configuration**
  - [x] Add missing `getSubject()` stub to the `Message` mock in `ContextPropagationIntegrationTest`
  - [x] Ensure the mocked subject value is consistent with the test scenario
  - [x] Verify the mock setup covers all `Message` methods accessed during test execution

- [x] **Task 2: Verify and Test**
  - [x] Run `nx test eaf-eventing-sdk` to confirm the test passes
  - [x] Run `nx run-many --target=test --all` to verify no regressions and successful parallel execution
  - [x] Confirm all other tests in `eaf-eventing-sdk` continue to pass

- [x] **Task 3: Documentation**
  - [x] Update any relevant test documentation if the fix reveals patterns for future MockK usage
  - [x] Document the resolution in this story for future reference

## Implementation Notes

### Current State Analysis

- **Test Intent**: Verify end-to-end context propagation through NATS message flow
- **Test Architecture**: Sound - uses proper mocking and context setup
- **Issue**: Incomplete MockK configuration missing `getSubject()` stub
- **Impact**: Blocks parallel test execution across entire codebase

### Technical Context

The test simulates the full flow:

1. Publisher publishes with security context and correlation ID
2. Message metadata is captured and used to create mock NATS message
3. Processor processes the mock message and restores context
4. Assertions verify context propagation worked correctly

The missing `getSubject()` stub is a simple oversight in the mock setup, not a fundamental architectural issue.

## Dependencies

- **Blocked by**: None
- **Blocks**: Full parallel test execution via `nx run-many --target=test --all`
- **Related**: Story 3.1.1 (Re-architect iam-service Tests for True Parallel Execution)

## Definition of Done

- [x] `ContextPropagationIntegrationTest` passes consistently
- [x] `nx test eaf-eventing-sdk` completes successfully
- [x] `nx run-many --target=test --all` completes successfully
- [x] No regressions in other `eaf-eventing-sdk` tests
- [x] Code follows project standards and MockK best practices

## Completion Summary

**✅ Story Successfully Completed**

All acceptance criteria have been met:

1. **✅ AC1**: The `ContextPropagationIntegrationTest.should propagate full context through NATS message flow()` test now passes consistently.
2. **✅ AC2**: All MockK stubs for the `Message` mock are properly configured, including the missing `getSubject()` method.
3. **✅ AC3**: The test maintains its original intent of verifying end-to-end context propagation through NATS messages.
4. **✅ AC4**: The `nx run-many --target=test --all` command now completes successfully without test failures.
5. **✅ AC5**: No regressions were introduced in other tests within the `eaf-eventing-sdk` module.

**Key Improvements Achieved:**

- Fixed incomplete MockK configuration by adding `every { mockMessage.subject } returns "test.subject"`
- Enabled successful parallel test execution across the entire codebase
- Completed the parallel test execution initiative started in Story 3.1.1
- Restored confidence in the CI/CD pipeline with reliable test feedback

**Technical Resolution:**

The issue was a simple but critical oversight in the MockK setup. The `DefaultMessageContext` constructor accesses three properties of the NATS `Message` object:

- `message.headers` ✅ (was already mocked)
- `message.data` ✅ (was already mocked)  
- `message.subject` ❌ (was missing - now fixed)

The fix was a single line addition that ensures all `Message` method calls are properly stubbed during test execution.
