# Story 2.7.2: Core Concepts Documentation on Launchpad

## Status: Completed

## Story

- **As a** Developer (Michael, Majlinda)
- **I want** to access well-structured documentation with clear explanations and Kotlin/React code examples on "The Launchpad" for core EAF architectural concepts (EAF Overview, CQRS/ES principles as applied in EAF, DDD tactical patterns relevant to EAF services, Hexagonal Architecture implementation guidelines for EAF, TDD philosophy and practices for EAF) and for the APIs/usage of the MVP SDKs (Eventing SDK for NATS, Event Sourcing SDK for PostgreSQL, IAM client SDK)
- **so that** I can effectively build services according to EAF best practices and architectural principles without ambiguity about implementation patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **✅ Dedicated Navigation Sections**: "The Launchpad" contains dedicated, easily navigable sections for "Core Architectural Concepts" and "EAF SDK Reference" with clear hierarchical organization and quick access navigation.

2. **✅ Core Architectural Concepts Documentation**: The "Core Architectural Concepts" section clearly explains how DDD (Aggregates, Events, Commands), Hexagonal Architecture (Ports, Adapters for common concerns like REST, NATS, DB), CQRS/ES, and TDD are expected to be implemented within the ACCI EAF context, with illustrative conceptual diagrams and comprehensive code snippets.

3. **✅ EAF SDK Reference Documentation**: The "EAF SDK Reference" provides comprehensive API documentation (KDoc generated and presented, or manually written guides with code examples) for key public classes, methods, and configuration options in the `eaf-eventing-sdk`, `eaf-eventsourcing-sdk`, and `eaf-iam-client-sdk`.

4. **✅ Practical Code Examples**: Code examples are provided in Kotlin for backend SDK usage and TypeScript/React for frontend interactions, showing practical application of the SDKs with proper error handling, configuration, and integration patterns.

5. **✅ Implementation Guidelines**: Each architectural concept includes specific implementation guidelines, best practices, common pitfalls to avoid, and decision trees for choosing appropriate patterns.

6. **✅ Cross-Reference Integration**: All documentation sections are properly cross-referenced with the Getting Started guide and include links to relevant SDK examples and architectural decision records.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story focuses on creating comprehensive architectural and SDK documentation that serves as the definitive reference for EAF development. The documentation must demonstrate deep understanding of architectural principles and provide practical, tested guidance.

- Story is ready for review and deployment.

### Change Log

- **Created**: December 2024 - Initial story creation with comprehensive structure and technical guidance
- **Completed**: January 2025 - Full implementation of all documentation, including content creation, structural organization, and technical fixes.

## Notes

**Success Metrics**:

- Developer can find specific architectural guidance within 2 minutes
- SDK implementation questions are answered without external resources
- Code examples can be copied and used directly in projects
- Architectural decisions are clearly justified and documented
- Cross-references enable efficient navigation between related concepts

**Dependencies**:

- EAF SDK modules must be stable for KDoc generation
- Architectural patterns from Getting Started guide should be referenced
- Visual diagram tooling (Mermaid) integration required
- Search functionality must be optimized for new content

**Risk Mitigation**:

- SDK API stability: Coordinate with SDK development teams for stable interfaces
- Content maintenance: Establish process for keeping documentation current with SDK changes
- User adoption: Plan validation testing with developers of varying experience levels
- Technical complexity: Balance comprehensive coverage with practical usability

This story has established "The Launchpad" as the definitive reference for EAF architectural principles and SDK usage, enabling developers to build high-quality, architecturally sound EAF services with confidence and consistency.
