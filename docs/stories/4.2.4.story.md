# Story 4.2.4: Create Integration Tests for Security Context

## Status: To Do

## Story
- **As a** Developer
- **I want** to write integration tests to verify that the `CorrelationDataProvider` is correctly wired and that all events created by command handlers are automatically enriched with the correct security metadata
- **so that** I have confidence in our implicit audit trail.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new integration test class is created for verifying security context propagation.
2. The test uses `@SpringBootTest` to load the application context.
3. A test case sets up a mock security context (e.g., using `@WithMockUser` or similar).
4. The test dispatches a command using the `CommandGateway`.
5. The test uses an event store inspection utility or a test event handler to capture the resulting event.
6. Assertions verify that the event's metadata contains the correct `tenant_id`, `user_id`, and other context from the mock security context.

## Dev Technical Guidance

- **Test Location**: `apps/acci-eaf-control-plane/src/test/kotlin/com/axians/eaf/controlplane/integration/security/`
- **Dependencies Required**: Add to test dependencies:
  ```kotlin
  testImplementation(libs.spring.boot.starter.test)
  testImplementation(libs.spring.security.test)
  testImplementation(libs.axon.test)
  testImplementation(libs.testcontainers.postgresql)
  testImplementation(libs.awaitility)
  ```
- **Test Configuration Pattern**:
  ```kotlin
  @SpringBootTest(classes = [ControlPlaneApplication::class])
  @ActiveProfiles("test")
  @Testcontainers
  @Import(SecurityContextTestConfiguration::class)
  ```
- **Custom Test Annotation**:
  ```kotlin
  @Target(AnnotationTarget.FUNCTION, AnnotationTarget.CLASS)
  @Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
  @WithSecurityContext(factory = WithMockEafUserSecurityContextFactory::class)
  annotation class WithMockEafUser(
      val tenantId: String = "TENANT_A",
      val userId: String = "test-user",
      val email: String = "test@example.com",
      val roles: Array<String> = ["USER"]
  )
  ```
- **Event Capture Pattern**: Use test event handlers with CountDownLatch for async verification
- **Assertion Strategy**: Use structured assertions for correlation metadata:
  ```kotlin
  assertThat(event.metaData)
      .containsEntry("tenant_id", "TENANT_A")
      .containsEntry("user_id", "test-user")
      .containsKey("correlation_id")
      .containsKey("request_timestamp")
  ```
- **Test Data Strategy**: Use realistic domain commands and events that mirror production usage
- **Isolation Strategy**: Each test should clean up event store and reset security context

## Testing Guidance

- **Objective**: Provide comprehensive confidence in security context propagation and audit trail completeness
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  - **Basic Security Context Propagation**:
    - Single user, single tenant command processing
    - Verify all expected metadata fields are present
    - Test different authentication methods and user types
    - Validate correlation data format and content
  - **Multi-Tenant Scenarios**:
    - Multiple tenants in same test execution
    - Tenant switching within single test context
    - Cross-tenant access prevention verification
    - Tenant-specific correlation data validation
  - **Complex Command Chains**:
    - Commands that trigger multiple events
    - Event handlers that dispatch new commands
    - Saga-based long-running processes
    - Error scenarios and compensation events
  - **Request Context Integration**:
    - Web request correlation data propagation
    - Different request types (REST, GraphQL, etc.)
    - Request context inheritance in async processing
    - Non-web context handling (scheduled tasks, messages)
  - **Performance and Concurrency**:
    - High-concurrency command processing
    - Multiple users simultaneous access
    - Memory usage under sustained load
    - Correlation data extraction performance
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - 100% of events contain correct security correlation metadata
  - No tenant data bleeding in any test scenario
  - Complete audit trail reconstruction possible from event metadata
  - Performance overhead for correlation data <5ms per command
  - All async event processing includes proper correlation data
- **Audit Trail Validation**:
  - Every user action traceable through correlation metadata
  - Sufficient data for regulatory compliance reporting
  - Complete request context for security incident investigation
  - Correlation data consistency across service boundaries
- **Error Scenario Coverage**:
  - Missing security context handling
  - Malformed correlation data recovery
  - Security validation failures with proper audit
  - System process vs user action differentiation
- **Tools**: JUnit 5, Spring Boot Test, Spring Security Test, Axon Test Framework, Awaitility for async verification, AssertJ for fluent assertions
